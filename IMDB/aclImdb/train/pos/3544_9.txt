guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more it embodies what people have forgotten about musicalsmusicals were made to entertain not to to preach nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando the guy cant sing it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i couldnt understand him if it werent for marlon i would have given this 10 stars guys and dolls provides oldfashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days watch it to have a good time
