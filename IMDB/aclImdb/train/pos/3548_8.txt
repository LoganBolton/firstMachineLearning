just saw this movie version of frank loessers guys and dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before she was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of jean simmons and marlon brando and she thought the havana sequences where simmons and brando dance up a storm were excellent those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film directed by joseph l mankiewicz this movie which originated as a story by damon runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the nonmusical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while the other story with frank sinatra and vivian blaine wasnt as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the sue me number also loved stubby kayes sit down youre rocking the boat number and the performances of sheldon leonard and b s pully with a theatrical look throughout guys and dolls isnt a great film musical but certainly a very good one
