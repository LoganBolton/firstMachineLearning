itd be easy to call guys and dolls great its got frank sinatra and marlon brando and contrary to sinatras original wishes the casting works its got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption and most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself if its not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldnt be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l mankiewicz not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like its being performed for the stage as opposed to film its hard to tell at times brando and sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screenbr br the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999s shes all that well not quite but close a gambler and 14year betrothed played by sinatra wants to host a bigtime game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch so he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab the only way he can get it is through a bigtime bet with fellow gambler brando whos put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker it allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turnonturnoff of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by jean simmons who falls for brando it is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other obviously without getting married or too compromisedbr br mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in hell even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and bigstar quality the story and characters eventually wind down to what youd hope will happen and thats fine all we ask for and what we get is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down my favorites were the number with the ladycats at the club luck be a lady and the two numbers down in havana cuba a
