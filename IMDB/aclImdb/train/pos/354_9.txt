a group of modelcaliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentines day cards who is the killer and why is the killer after them br br my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a filmsometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down however i cant remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awfuli gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade watching it for a second time last night i cant remember what the heck i didnt like about it i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe i just didnt get it in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an abr br it might sound ridiculous saying i didnt get a film like this but there is something to get valentine is almost a comedyhorror director jamie blanks who was also responsible for 1998s urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream 1996 and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesycampy almost to the point of absurdity where absurdism is a positive stylistic term on top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the valentines day themebr br many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichérooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichéd implausible and ludicrous its as if blanks is attempting and mostly succeeding to transcend the typical teen slasher by mockingspoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros thats the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentines day its an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for valentines extravagant lampooning scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was selfaware valentines day is intentionally not selfaware the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire lest some think im reading too much into the film its worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he didnt want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adultbr br other viewers may dislike the fact that valentines day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by tom savage the novels characters setting and plot are very different from the film sellers has said while it was a fine book i didnt think it was the right story for a film so instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horrorthriller story centered on valentines day while those facts wont help purists familiar with the book like the film its helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude its probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar themebr br blanks direction is impeccable visually valentines day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action he also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances david boreanaz as adam carr is involved in many of the funniest momentsbr br while valentines day is no masterpiece its a very good horrorthriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions if you watch it expecting something more tongueincheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more
