oh this is such a glorious musical theres a bit of miscasting  frank sinatra is sorely miscast as the jewish nathan detroit though it only becomes evident on sue me which is a distinctly jewish song sadly the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show marry the man today and replaced it with an inferior sinatra showpiece with these two flaws in mind the movie is otherwise magnificent jean simmons shines as sarah brown marlon brando cant sing worth beans but pulls it off anyway stubby kaye wonderfully reprises his broadway role it was written for him damon runyons language and pacing and humor come through quite well this is on my seeiteverychanceiget list
