along with south pacific guys and dolls is for grownups   it is sassy sexy and full of men being men and women being strung alongbr br there is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack  the strength of jean simmonds performance and the charm of a young brando and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piecebr br guys and dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is an mgm musicalbr br still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers  it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to comebr br warmly recommended
