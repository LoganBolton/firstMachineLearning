i love this movie my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changedbr br its true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but its also nice that its not just another frank sinatra movie where its mostly him doing the singingbr br i actually thought it was better to use marlon brandos own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voicebr br stubby kayes sit down youre rockin the boat is a foottappin singalong that i just love he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the bestbr br vivian blaine is just excellent in this part and adelaides lament is my favorite of her songsbr br i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part it made sensebr br michael kidds choreography is timeless if it were being re staged in the year 2008 i would not change a thingbr br i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage even though it was on filmbr br i thought the movie was well cast i performed in regional versions of this and its one of my favorites of that period
