im intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards or sympathy for sinatra in the other reviews here ive read elsewhere that sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for not being cast as sky mastersonbr br ok so who wouldnt want to be cast as sky masterson  its a great part the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet in which he must take salvation army sargeant sarah brown on a date to cuba or lose its not the money  its the pride but he and she meet their match meanwhile nathan detroit must juggle his longsuffering fiancée adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it doesnt alienate his fiancée forever firstbr br the film started life as a series of short stories by damon runyon thats his unique dialogue you hear and those are his great character names and thats his horseracingnightclublate night gambling world then it became a musical and you cant help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage the camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably  and not pleasingly  flat and childlike fortunately the music is so great i dont care that muchbr br my absolute favourite thing about this film though is the singing and acting of the two nonsingers brando as sky and jean simmons as sargeant sarah brown of course putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto acting ability and pathos pathos pathos youre with sky as he argues with sarah against reason steadiness pipes and safety you enjoy sarahs loosening up under the influence of cuban milk you feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home as sky rightly says its chemistry pro singers  be they broadway belters or smooth crooners  cant necessarily be relied on to make this happen and they certainly didnt i read somewhere that brando criticised sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of nathan detroit sinatra in turn was infuriated by brandos fourtake acting method as a brando fan does it show im bound to take the other side but i cant imagine that this film would have been the muchadored classic it is today if brando and simmons hadnt been in it with their wonderful chemistry brandos unpredictability simmons face all pink cheeks and brown hair drunk and ashamed in a cuban bar beautiful ill always want a copy of this film lying around in case i need to feel good again youll forgive me if give some of the nathan sleeptalking parts the 100 brushoff though wont you you wont oh be quiet and have some more of mindys cheesecake
