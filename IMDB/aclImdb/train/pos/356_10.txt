turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axewielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour which can be very easy to get wrong too muchnot enough which meant it didnt get too dark nor too spoofy it was a great step up from eaves other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out cant wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
