i dont think a movie like this would be released today it takes its time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isnt full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seatbr br but what this film does have an interesting study in how families deal with grief how when the language for healing and overcoming tremendous loss leaves us mute and we rely on raw emotions instead grief without reason and patience is anger even hate and unfortunately the lead character a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting in the film is given more than his fair share of it he eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather wilford brimley who makes it clear to him that it was an accident i got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart but needed to hear those words from his parents and to receive their forgivenessbr br what i loved about this film the lack of dialog there was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction facial expressions and the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors something we dont get to do alot of with todays filmsbr br
