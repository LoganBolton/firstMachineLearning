heres yet another film from the 80s that most people just dont know exists this slow picturesque the loving shots of the montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of costners recent open range which also starred robert duval and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you cant sleep or on a listless sunday afternoon those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting the performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced glenn close robert duval and wilford brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors i especially liked how director cain who unfortunately hasnt directed anything of note since this except the first young guns gives us quiet little glimpses into everyones personal grief we dont just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenagers girlfriend what we essentially get here is the rural midwestern answer to ordinary people theres also shades of david lynchs the straight story in some of the stoic downhome midwest morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit this is one of the better and more realistic tearjerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there
