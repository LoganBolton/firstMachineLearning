michelle rodrigez was made for this movie when i first saw her in fast and the furious you could tell that she was a tough woman with this movie she has not only proven her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie she is more a bad girl and thats what i like about her this movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her even though they dont think she has the potential they get to be shown proven wrongbr br  i think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done it shows that people can do anything even if they dont think you have the potential i recommend it to be seen
