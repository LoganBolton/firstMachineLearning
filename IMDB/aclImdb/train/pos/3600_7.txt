at first glance i expected this film to be crappy because i thought the plot would be so excessively feminist but i was wrong as you maybe have read in earlier published comments i agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother i never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman its like guzman is presented as somebody with a spine this in contrast to her classmates so i was surprised by the story in fact i thought it was quite good except for the predictable end maybe it wouldve been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist so that the viewer is somewhat more surprisedbr br in addition id like to say that rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character i cant really explain why but especially in the love scenes she convinced me it just looked real i thinkbr br i gave it a 7 out of 10 merely because of the dull last half hour
