michelle rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for she has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen toughgirl role very early in her career and pull it off which is a feat that should be recognized although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role this film was made for her ruggednessbr br her character is a romanticized studentfighterlover struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects which is a little overdone in filmbut not by a girl that aspect of this film isnt very original but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes overbr br i havent seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in moviemaking yet and im glad that shes getting that original twist out there in hollywood this film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth but it has such a great actress portraying a rarelyseen role in a minimal budget movie great work
