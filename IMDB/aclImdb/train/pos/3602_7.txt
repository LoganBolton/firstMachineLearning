while the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for selfrespect and anger management is hardly a new thing the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boybr br diana has trouble at school she just cant stay away from fighting at home her father is constantly putting her down her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to trainbr br it would be easy to call this movie a rocky with girls i guess but that is not at all what this is about the story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy that way you can deal with more problems at once first the problem of her not being accepted because shes not a girliegirl and then when she comes to the boxing gym because shes a girl at all its also a story about how a purpose can change someones life how positive things can make you grow i dont want this to sound pretentious because the movie doesnt feel pretentious at all but what im saying is truebr br also michelle rodriguez is very good in the lead its a shame really that she has become stuck in the tough girl typecasting now because thats really not what her part in girlfight is all about sure shes a female boxer but rather its the more sensitive moments that really makes her shinebr br so maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist but its lifted way above the crowd by rodriguez performance i rate this 710
