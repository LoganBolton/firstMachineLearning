girlfight is much more of a comingofagestory than it is a fight flick and what a relief to have one in an urban school with naturalistic realistic latinos and believable use of brooklyn project settings br br it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns even the somewhat comparable love and basketball which focused on teen africanamericans was set in suburbia while these kids share some of the same peer problems those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their livesbr br the feminist element here is riveting in its originality as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationshipand a victory on her terms a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a genderbendingexpectations situationbr br the movie does drag a bit here and there but this is no cheap thrills rocky fight movie as the practices and fights have complex outcomes and all the relationshipsespecially with fathers and fatherfigures take more center stage than the center ring br br there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end but i hadnt really noticed the songsbr br originally written 1072000
