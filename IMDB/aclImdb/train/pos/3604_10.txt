i think its a great movie because you get to see how dianas life at home is she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because its alright between diana and adrian but you dont get to see how it is at home and i didnt really like it that you also dont get to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think im going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you dont like boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it
