so i flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought id pass a half hour watching girlfight while waiting for harts war to start with a title like that i figured it was some exploitation b flic about inner city girl gangsbr br much to my surprise it wasnt about that at all instead it is a well acted well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing she is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts as he doesnt really want to be a boxer only following through on their fathers wishes she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead br br the story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest for starters her brothers coach doesnt want to take on a female boxer after grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on yes a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot coming across more of an interesting interhuman reaction with its own fight related consequencesbr br all in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed million dollar baby i thought wait a minute this seems kind of familiar needless to say i didnt watch harts war that night
