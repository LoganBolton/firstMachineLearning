i saw this movie after i saw blue crush and other of michelles movies i thought she had a bleak future in this businessi was extremely wrong after watching her performance in girlfight i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter but also a warriorin this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother the way she conveys anger when getting hither characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love or that just because she has power she wont wini believe this role was fit perfectly for michelle even though she had no prior experience the director saw talent i criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her
