michelle rodriguez is a wellbuilt highschool senior who discovers that she has a powerful punch and begins amateur training at a brooklyn gym santiago douglas is a a handsome young man barely older than she who also trains there they meet after class so to speak and feel attracted to each other no sex santiago has been instructed to save it for his next boutbr br both are participants in a genderblind athletic program that makes no distinctions between males and females a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing fieldbr br a conservative radio commentator recently announced  and i swear im not making this up  lets face it the president is black im here to make an equally perspicacious observation  men and women are different now in 99 cases out of 100 this neednt make any difference in physical performance but in the top one percent  trained athletes whose skills have been honed to a fine edge  men generally have the advantage with their narrow hips they can run faster and they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength these differences in body build make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them this sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection without it there might not be any humans at all and that boys and girls is why they have mens events and womens events at the olympics i speak to you as your anthropologist that will be ten cents paypal preferredbr br thats why i called this genderblind program misguided as talented a boxer as rodrigues is as she approaches the zenith of the game she will eventually lose to a malebr br thats where the complication arises in this movie rodrigues is finally matched against her boy friend douglas neither wants to loose any anger on the other not to mention roundhouse rights but the pride of both is at stake and the pride is both personal and gender related douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring and rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his patronizing attitude it ends happilybr br i wasnt really expecting much from the film i thought it would be a rip off of clint eastwoods million dollar baby until i discovered that this was released years earlier and id never heard of the director or of any of the performers that sort of obscurity generally augers ill  madefortelevision weepers and so forthbr br but i was surprised at how neatly this is put together the total absence of bathos left me open mouthed so did the minimal use of boxing clich√©s  the frayed ropes the blood the cutting of the swollen eye the battered postbout faces the fat and sweaty onlooker shouting kill him the slow motion landing of glove on nose the spray of sweat from the mauled head the heroic music signaling the longawaited apotheosis of the victor none of that here  well almost none the whole plot could be considered formulaic tough kid finds outlet in the ring etcbr br the feeling youre left with is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur contests are like different from those we see on tv and in ordinary movies no bells ring for instance instead a dancing and observant referee yells stop and box the contestants wear head gear the gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering spectators but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the goings on its a clean movie despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamicsbr br michelle rodriguez can look pretty mean what with her muscular bulk and her eyes glowing under her lowered brow but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to a pulp anytime she wants and once you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmentals she aint bad a scene in which she battles her father to the floor is overdoing it it was a little hard to understand douglass restraint when rodriguez crawls all over him in bed the director karyn kusama has chosen her talent carefullybr br shows what you can do with some talent imagination and a modicum of money there ought to be more films like it take one of those multibillion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity around a little
