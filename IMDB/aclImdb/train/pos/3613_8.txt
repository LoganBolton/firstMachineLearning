when girlfight came out the reviews praised it but i didnt get around to seeing it i finally saw it when it got released on video and understand the glowing reviewsbr br the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto we quickly get introduced to student diana guzman michelle rodriguez she has a badass expression on her face and any idea about diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight as diana gets in trouble for this we then meet her father an aggressive type in his own right clearly we cant totally blame diana for her attitudebr br but then the movie really picks up as a new thought germinates in dianas mind boxing as a way to escape this grim existence her older brother has already gotten into boxing but her father most likely wont approve only diana herself can decide what to dobr br just the first few minutes alone identified that i was in for a very gritty nonhollywood movie but the brief appearance of john sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that even before they get to any boxing scenes you feel like youre getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that diana lives and when they finally arrive at the films main story theres no turning backbr br all in all i definitely recommend this movie i will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himselfherself has been sort of a clich√© in cinema for many years rocky million dollar baby but i still think that they did a great job with it here in fact this may have brought the genre to its apex really good too bad that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movies after this one
