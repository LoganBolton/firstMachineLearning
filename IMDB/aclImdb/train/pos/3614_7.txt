girlfight is like your grandmothers cooking same old recipe youve tried a million times before yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new try and explain the story to people who havent seen it before a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés and theyre right it is clichéd yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue and sensitive direction that makes it new i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but dont make the same mistake i did definiately worth a look
