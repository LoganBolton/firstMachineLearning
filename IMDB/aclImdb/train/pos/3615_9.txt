i was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of girlfight its an indie lowbudget no bigname actors freshman director i had heard it was good but not this goodbr br placed in a contemporary ethnic workingclass brooklyn karyn kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the daydoday struggles of urban latinos diana the protagonist is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers getting in trouble with the school and her friends she is being raised by her single father who appears to love her and her brother but applies a strict sexbased double standard on his children the fathers double standard is illustrated by the fact that tiny the brother is taking boxing lessons at the local gym but diana is denied similar pursuits on an errand to the gym to meet tiny diana is captivated by boxing tiny doesnt like boxing so he and diana trade places he gets the money from dad then gives it to diana to take the lessons in his placebr br this is actually a feelgood movie as diana grows and learns about herself through boxing meets a guy and addresses some very serious issues headon theres no giggly everything that can go right does go right resolution a la bend it like beckham the reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions but in my opinion girlfight is a better and more satisfying film for it
