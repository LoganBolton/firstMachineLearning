despite disneys best efforts this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams i was surprised that it didnt strike me as oversentimental this movie played fair dennis quaid was very very good in the role which is saying something for a sports movie i cant recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me here everybody looks the part this movie is surprisingly good and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a grated movie that doesnt require the viewer to stop thinking ebert to the contrary this movie is a success
