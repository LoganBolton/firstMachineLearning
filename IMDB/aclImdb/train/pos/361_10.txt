like i said at the top four stars just arent enough its one of the best films ive ever seen in my almost 17 years of life for the people that dont really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention spanbr br even if i havent seen all his films yet id have to say that this is spielberg at his peak its pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple dont come along too often cause i think all of us are in desperate need of firstclass motion picture entertainment in these hard timesbr br movies like this are more than just movies theyre pieces of art that need to be appreciated morebr br the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars even best picture of the year and didnt get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasnt even nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that yearbr br the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some peoplebr br if only movies were still this good
