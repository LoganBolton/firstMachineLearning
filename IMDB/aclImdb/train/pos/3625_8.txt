this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives br br laced with dreams  dripping in reality the american dream reignites after 911 with a true story about the devil rays midlife rookie jimmy morris australian born actress rachel griffiths plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know and dennis quaid was perfection  cast as the wannabe gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience its real the onscreen chemistry works if you like baseball heartwarmers youre going to love this film the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there my popcorn became the a la mode br br and hey buy the cd the music rocks and carries the story magnificently syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should an area that disappoints me more often than notbr br criticisms id have given the baseball to somebody else but quaid has something to teach us all about character and heart st rita and the nuns were a nice decoration but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them a little long worth every minute in the last analysis 8  10 br br
