the movie actually has a fairly good story but gets bogged down in several key places its almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role but something is clearly missing from several key scenesbr br this 25 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown togetherbr br
