i first saw this movie 3 years ago and it was introduced by then disney chief eisner and the real jim morrisbr br about a month ago it came back on tv and this time i taped it since then i mustve watched it at least three timesbr br this is a wonderful inspirational feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned it resists going for every sentimental trick in the book as well as all of the other clich√©sbr br it is refreshing to see a movie where the kids arent jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues and the jocks arent portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheadsbr br these are just normal people who have dreams like you and ibr br in my opinion hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term gritty realism making movies where everyone curses and has problems with aggressionbr br this movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream the people in big lake tx seem so personable that i want to move therebr br as i said b4 the film doesnt try to go overboard with sentimentality dennis quaid as usual never disappoints ive watched him from the late 70s and he is so underratedbr br but this movie has excellent performances from everyone concerned and kudos to the writersbr br a gem in the movie is near the end when jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game and his wife calls out to him from the stands he rushes over and reaches out to his family the look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is pricelessbr br if youre looking for a change of pace then pick this movie up
