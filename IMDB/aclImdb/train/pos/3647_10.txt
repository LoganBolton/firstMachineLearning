i love it when they actually do a sports story well so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch not this one its just a genuinely nice movie an oldfashioned type of story  and based on a reallife guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out late in life athleticallyspeaking to become a pitcher in professional baseball eventually he reaches his goal of making it to the major leagues even if it was a very brief stintbr br all the characters in here are nice people the kind you root for from quaid to the players on his high school team to his little boy angus t jones now somewhat of a star on televisionbr br quaid is believable in playing jim morris because unlike actors in the past in sports films he knows how to throw a baseball he looks like a pitcher a guy who could fire it 90plus miles per hour and most of this film is true as testified by the reallife pitcher in one the documentaries on the dvdbr br so if youre looking for a nice inspirational true life sports film you cant wrong with this one
