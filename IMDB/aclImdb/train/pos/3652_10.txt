i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick i was wrongbr br pandoras clock is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies it could just as easily have made its debut on the big screenbr br the cast is excellent including veteran actors richard dean anderson edward herrmann robert guillaume and robert loggia daphne zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the cia and frasiers jane leeves is also very good br br the dialogue is wellwritten and the story is compelling throughout in fact the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you cant leave your seat for a second if you get a chance to see this movie invest the time  nearly four hours you will be richly rewarded
