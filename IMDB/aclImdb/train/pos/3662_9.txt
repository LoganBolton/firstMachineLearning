this is a really strange filmand that is not a bad thing it is a combination of a neorealistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale im sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange but i loved it once again this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people not actors and gets a great ensembletype performance although not nearly as sad as umberto d both movies have a very similar point to makethis one just does it in a very absurdist way ignore the cheesy special effectsafter all it was made in the early 1950s and special effects arent terribly important anyway or at least they shouldnt be in films instead just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride unless you are a total curmudgeon youll have a ballbr br by the way since i first reviewed this film i have seen another desica directed film that is an absolute mustsee and that is the children are watching us while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in milan a great film nevertheless
