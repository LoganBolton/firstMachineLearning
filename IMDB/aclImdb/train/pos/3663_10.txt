perhaps the last film you would expect to come from vittorio de sica and cesare zavattini who wrote the novel on which this film is based its a neorealist fantasy kind of an oxymoron really an old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son after a few years the baby is a young boy named toto and the adoptive mother is dying he goes to an orphanage and when he finally turns 18 he leaves immediately he finds that he has no home toto is optimistic though and wont let anything get him down a man steals his valise and instead of getting angry over it toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown soon the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves after many attempts the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless at this point the film becomes fullfledged fantasy before this it was more comedicfantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin this stuff is so weird and shocking that its probably best for others to see it for themselves its quite amazing and very funny there are objections you could raise about the plot of miracle in milan most certainly fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from neorealism i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release at this point though its so enjoyable  i loved it very much it might be my favorite of vittorio de sicas films although umberto d and the bicycle thieves come very very close 1010
