i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect  and as i am about to study filmmaking in canada of all places i most certainly will bring this up in classbr br the story centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on timebr br if you simply couldnt laugh during hollywood north i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away  you might have serious issuesbr br besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine  where they really just acting jennifer tilly playing a hilariously bad actress and martin landau also delivered a very edgy yet funny performancebr br great film even better cast
