back in 2004 i saw true tom tykwers contribution to paris je taime when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much of course i wanted to watch the whole film and i would even check who was attached etcbr br yesterday i finally saw it courtesy of the internetbr br first of all i must say that it looks awesome the photography is beautiful in every short and shot at the worst being nothing special  but still brilliant and clear later i read the trivia here and maybe its how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dps work my special favorites are the quais de seine first scene that sunlight the sin cityesquire but better for me quartier de la madeleine and 14th arrondisement  but you know what the hell i like them all true or faubourg saintdenis still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours my eyes they tremble and quartier latin is gold imprisoned on silver beautifulbr br yes these are some beautiful short filmsbr br now lets get onto the content i very much and i mean very much like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazychinesemusicalinpariswithbarbetschroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue i love surprises and this film has them its great they took a chance to let all these directors flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema which i have come to heavily despise its not heavily experimental but i can breath the breathing space these people hadbr br i like the small time and i love the acting i love the simplicity and i love the love i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general its a film that is very very very nice to see alone or with someone to simply feel it left me feeling very goodbr br there is something about the earnestness in it its so frankbr br what i didnt like well for me there are two shorts that arent exactly the best  quais de seine which is good natured sure and maybe even necessary but feels too much like a commercial and p√®relachaise that even though i love the acting i felt its themes were forced but that of course is just me tour eiffel i also didnt love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet i dont know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actors and directors and so they can delight in their interaction in the surprises look out for alexander payne in a funny role and basically in what will this director do with this great question i enjoyed it very much in that waybr br i repeat now most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix i definitely recommend it definitely so watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love
