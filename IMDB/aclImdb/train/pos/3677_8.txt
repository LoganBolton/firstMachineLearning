thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently thought id missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest paris je taime is a collection of 20 short films about 5 mins each by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary parisbr br one of my fave segments is parc monceau by alfonso cuarn great expectations harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which was done in one continuous shot and features nick noltebr br the coen brothers tuileries starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious  juliette binoche and willem dafoe in place des victoires was hauntingbr br for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actressdruggie in quartier des enfants rouges to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliantbr br elijah wood as a vampire victim in quartier de la madeleine was pretty surreal while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes cravens prelachaisebr br natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in faubourg saintdenis but despite the many portrayals of young love a more mature execution by gena rowlands in quartier latin was equally awwinducingbr br this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought ofbr br there are also a number of memorable quotes one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days in pretending to be a man in love he became a man in love
