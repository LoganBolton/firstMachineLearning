its a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are 2 minus points  the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring  a lot of stories are not selfcontained if you compare to fe coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall its one of the best movies this year for surebr br annoying that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum i havent got more to say and i dont want to start analyzing the single sequencesbr br well i think thats it
