wasnt sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didnt disappointbr br for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent which made me feel better about mine which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the moviebr br the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scopebr br however the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical the dialogue in wes cravens section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensiblebr br on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish its not too painful to sit through the bad sections  they only last 5 minutes anywaybr br ca vaut la peine
