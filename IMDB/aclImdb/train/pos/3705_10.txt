i dont understand the low 57 rating on this film its a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil down to the locale savannah the acting is strong and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branaghs southern accent famke jansen is great robert duval is effective in a small part and embeth davitz is the bomb great full nude scene of hertoobr br the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed
