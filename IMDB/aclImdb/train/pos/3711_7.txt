the gingerbread man is the first thriller ive ever done  robert altman br br in 1955 charles laughton directed the night of the hunter a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer one of the films more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a rowboat the kids frantically paddling whilst mitchum wades after them like a monster br br seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in cape fear another film set in the american south that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum terrorising folks on a boat in 1991 martin scorsese trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream remade cape fear boat scene and allbr br now we have robert altmans the gingerbread man another slice of small town southern gothic altman says he consulted the night of the hunter for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to spread his wings and try a popcorn picture but what hes secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genrebr br so instead of a showdown on small boat we get a showdown on a giant ship instead of two kids being kidnapped we get two kids being safely returned to the police instead of money being hidden we have money being readily given via a last will and testament instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake we get a rather threedimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys instead of the monster breaking into the familys house boat we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monsters house ship similarly instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall  etc etc etcbr br altman goes on and on reversing everything just a little slightly pulling at the edges and doing his own thing his touch is most apparent during the films first halfhour the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plotdriven movie storytelling and altmans fondness for overlapping dialogue casual narratives prowling camera movement and the way that characters arent so much introduced as they are simply part of whats going onbr br still despite altmans best intentions the film never rises above mediocrity altmans too bound to the conventions of the thriller format to do much damage his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre gingerbread man is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thrillerbr br the films not a complete waste though robert downey junior kenneth branagh and the usually intolerable daryl hannah all turn in juicy performances the film also has a nice atmosphere set against a approaching hurricane and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns while its not the complete disaster that scorseses cape fear was the film still never amounts to anything specialbr br 710  in the late 90s altman made 3 successive films set in the american south kansas city gingerbread man and cookies fortune unlike gingerbread man both kansas city and cookies fortune tackle the genre on the broader more looser canvases that altman was most comfortable with br br kansas city is the more important of these two films its hierarchies of class politics and crime and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers see for example the wire that said cookies fortune while a much slighter tale is perhaps the better picturebr br note altman claims that this is his first thriller but he directed images an art house thriller in 1972br br worth one viewing
