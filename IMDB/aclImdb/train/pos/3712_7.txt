robert altman shouldnt make a movie like this but the fact that he did and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightlywound thriller in that paperbacktradition of grisham thrillers shows a versatility that is commendable in the gingerbread man he actually has to work with something that unfortunately he isnt always very successful at or at least its not the first thing on his checklist as director plot theres one of those big juicy almost potboiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate lowclass woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways twists and plot ensues yada yada and its surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these i saw that coming from back there endings or just a such a semiconventional thrillerbr br but its a surprise that pays off because oddly enough altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very wellcast ensemble of a smalltown georgian environment the film drips with atmosphere if not total superlative craftsmanship sometimes its good and sometimes just decent for altman as savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid so the atmosphere is really potent but so are performances from sometimes hysterical kenneth branaugh embeth davitz as the woman who lawyer branaugh gets caught up with and robert downey jr when is he not good as the private detective in branaughs employ did i neglect robert duvall who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the badvibes of the picture on br br as said some of the plot is a little weak or just kind of standard lawyer is divorced bitter custody battle looms innocent and goofy kids but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material something darker than some of the other grisham works that has this standing out somehow if its not entirely masterful it still works on its limited terms as a whatwillhappennext mysterysouthernnoir
