first off i didnt know what to expect when i started the videobr br anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present something gets inexplicably lost in the translationbr br thats not the case here this movie just starts off on the right track its part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well crockzilla scene anyone that has to be seen and just try and keep a straight face this movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production its good to see someone is filling the need in this market very well donebr br
