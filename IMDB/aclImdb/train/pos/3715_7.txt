alright this was quite a sensitive little number but i cant help thinking ive seen it before reminds me of another vca film i saw at poitier called the other days of ruby rae also had specks of welcome to the dollhouse and ratcatcher and lynne ramsay in its execution which is not to say that theyre not tasteful referencesjust that they feel very modern and very fashionablewhich makes me feel like this is closer to advertising as an approach in style and story than the work of an original and authentic auteur to comebr br the cinematography is justtoo perfect for my liking too coral filter or charcoal for my likingtoo archly framed 12mm therefore the entire impression left me a little distant  beware of art that proclaims itself too readily the french they are a conservative bunch seemed to buy it as did the jury however but cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to its feature selection although i wonder whats been happening in the last few years
