first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel schumacher did it and that was enough for me a friend and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the nightfilm festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that wouldnt otherwise be shown in danish theatersbr br anyway my friend and i went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our bookbr br the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish initiative dogma 95 which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier dancer in the darkbr br in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american gi joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from homebr br also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i havent seen him before but i cant wait to see more of himbr br lars p helvard
