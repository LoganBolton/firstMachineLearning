i wasnt expecting the highest calibre of filmmaking with joel schumacher directing this one so i was surprised that tigerland wasnt a complete waste of timebr br in technique its often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work grainy shots the film occasionally running like its skipping a sprocketall those techniques speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything elsebr br but unlike saving private ryan the emotional component wasnt as weak as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived not so wrapped up in the american flag speilberg gets an f in subtletybr br next to the first section of kubricks full metal jacket this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film and for that i think its worth watchingbr br its not a great film but neither is it a bad film
