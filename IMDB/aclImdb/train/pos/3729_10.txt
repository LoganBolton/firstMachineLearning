while i suppose this film could get the rap as being antivietnam while watching it i didnt feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didnt support it showed their fear their desperation their drive all of it out in the open naked as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military  especially boot camp on the whole this movie although it was shot on a very small budget looks great is very well put together and features excellent acting and directing i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film 1010
