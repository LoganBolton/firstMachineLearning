steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldnt win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielbergs first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didnt give spielberg any respect the color purple received 11 oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasnt nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didnt win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasnt right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldbergs spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends of celie since im from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films release hadnt gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celies rotten husband all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindlers list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkablebr br  out of four
