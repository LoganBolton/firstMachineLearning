if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then tigerland is the film for you i love this movie from top to bottom this movies pictureperfect scenes look so real its almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama boy i tell you real drama they actually real fought in one of the scenes get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an illfated destiny after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an illfated destiny is and know exactly how the men in the film feel i see this movie as a crossbreed between stand by me and saving private ryan what do men do when they are with a situation thats hard pressed in real life some men go crazy some men cry some men through fists others do drugs some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life some try drink the pain away some jump off buildings or bridges some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse  physically this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball but dont get me wrong its not depressing movie its realistic its a very very humorous movie the cocky and funny bozz collins character lights it all up and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie ill let you figure out what their in there for with dialogue waraction sequences picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music this movie has it all like i said from top to bottom i dont why tigerland is heavily undercredited the best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing the best film of the year and it absolutely falls nothing short of that keep the rare gems coming hollywood 1010
