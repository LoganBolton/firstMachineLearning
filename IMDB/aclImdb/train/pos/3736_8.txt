in joel schumacher you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time but this is common knowledge i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur hitchcock liked his suspense and his horrorthriller chaplin liked his comedy scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about herebr br but schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy batman is a superhero superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me then comes 8mm a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before tigerland which is schumachers best film from what ive so far seen in my opinion with the war genre laughter isnt something youd associate with it for most of the time i can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the dday landings during saving private ryan at the time when i first saw the film i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished my eyebrows were up my mouth slightly open with a weak i cant believe it smile on my face needless to say it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole in tigerland you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through bozz farrell a tough and egotistical soldier training for the vietnam warbr br but whats clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time the things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school tigerland may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but egos and superegos play more of a part here i think the superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against bozz whose ego is extremely large there is also the third part of freuds triangle that sneaks into bozz the id compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldnt do to float to the surface and express itself you are all dead in this situation barks a sergeant any questions yeah if im dead how come i can ask a question replies bozz whose punishments such as pushups and dirt eating seem to unfaze him in true id style that is he enjoys the punishmentsbr br also regarding the superegos bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training this is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell bozz he is in charge what follows is an actual conversation between bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his christian name this is where private wilsons whigham character steps in his uncontrollable rage and anger at bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the films only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward bozz and acts outbr br what i also liked about tigerland is that its shot in such a way that is brave while lacking in innovation tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness but we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but schumacher is clever he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the films budget couldve been half of what it was its worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenesbr br while being very funny and entertaining tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy if not unhappy ending thatll open your mind and make you think about what its perhaps really like in the military
