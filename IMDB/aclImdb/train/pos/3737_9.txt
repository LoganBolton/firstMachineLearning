first off this movie was a wild ride the whole way the story of the training of the soldiers fighting with their superiors and in the end grouping togetherbr br from the very beginning to the very end this is one war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing at times beyond reason and the horrors of what boot camp arebr br the dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times and sometimes humorous how bozz colin farrel deals with paxton matthew davis throughout the storyline from camp to tigerland and even in the end helping himbr br the innovative freehand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film constant moving constant action and just constant confusion at times it was a help others not so muchbr br throughout the film it was increasingly realistic some points in the film the sex scenes in particular seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldnt have been there without them it was a very gritty movie through and throughbr br in my opinion this is one of colin farrels better movies if not his top performance the acting for every character was superb 910 sysnuk3r
