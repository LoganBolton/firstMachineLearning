i thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it is nothing newbr br everyone here is grouping it with other war movies this movie has been miscategorized its not a war movie any more than one flew over the cuckoos nest is a asylum movie or cool hand luke is a prison movie this is a movie about individuality nonconformity selfconfidence and the costs of that personality typebr br the plot is the same as one flew over the cuckoos nest and cool hand luke its in good company and it holds its own its these movies it should be held up against and compared not apocalypse now or platoonbr br eric
