i love this movieshort thing jason steele is amazing my favorite parts are the french song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells  spoons i crack up every time i would recommend this movie to knox klaymation fans and people who enjoy jason steeles other movies his style of animation is very original it takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds his humor is also hilarious and is definitely not something youd hear before like max the deformed spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life this is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where
