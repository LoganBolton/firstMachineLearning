ive never seen many online movies in most of my life but if id pick any of them id pick spatula madness a clever reference to most movies like star trooper etc using a camera and wits of steel jason steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with framebyframe animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas the story begins at the middle hows that for directors delight then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first watched it i expected a soggy pixely look but jason like me loves looks so took every detail to the max although i dont recommend it for children or would anybody besides me like it but please search it up on the net its a short film look up film cow its style reminds me of south park but less violent 10 for the look 6 for the laughs and 6 for the story it all comes to a 1010 good workbr br jason steele im anxious to see the movie
