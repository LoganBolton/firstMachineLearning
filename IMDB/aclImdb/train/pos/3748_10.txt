ive watched it plenty of times and im planning on buying the full feature i love all of jason steeles comedy its very different and unique and is very enjoyable i love indie films and this one is just great the plot is strange but very funny this short film is about a talking spatula named edward the order of the events are a bit jumbled making this film very interesting to watch at first you see edward fighting the spoons but then the focus changes to earlier in his life this is a silly movie but of course its still great i highly recommend that you watch this film at wwwspatulamadnesscom or wwwfilmcowcom its very funny the humour may not match everybodys taste but watch anyway itll only take 16 minutes of your time and its free go watch spatula madness
