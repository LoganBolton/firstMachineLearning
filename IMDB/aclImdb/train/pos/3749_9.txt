i laughed a lot while watching this its an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully theres max who has apparently led a horrible life and theres edward who isnt sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom edwards insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of jasons cartoons and cant wait to see what he comes out with next
