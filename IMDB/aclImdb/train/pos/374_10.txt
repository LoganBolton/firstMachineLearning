rating 1010 master piecebr br some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie  together with schindlers list  is your best even oprah acts well in this one br br what got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
