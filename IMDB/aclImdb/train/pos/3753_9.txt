this short film that inspired the soontobe full length feature  spatula madness  is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this films 15minute running time is absorbed by some oddball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesnt really have time to show but its surely follows it plot better than many highbudget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and dont expect a deep story
