made only ten years after the actual events and set in the bunker under the reichstag pabsts film is wholly gripping it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war havent seen this in over three decades but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave searing bit of dialog between two generals does god exist if he did we wouldnt shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge im toten winkel aka blind spot hitlers secretary and downfall with bruno ganz
