this movie is awesome if you take it too seriously of course you will hate it however its quantity of dudes and right ons brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago i like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor bill and teds excellent adventure 1989 if you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes and totally mature humor dont watch it however if you want a film that is humorous and silly yet intelligent and engaging you will enjoy it i actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in todays theatres and hey its keanu reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as actingrightdoesnt get much better than that
