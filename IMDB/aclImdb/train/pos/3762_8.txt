alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first moviebr br the only difference is that their trip is somewhere between heaven and hell and ends up being both when they meet the grim reaper they get the chance of an afterlifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have besides playing roles they haveerperfected they also play and revive a couple of extra sales in the process some classic games i even have my original copy of battleship in the closetbr br the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with what it might be like instead of what was without spoiling the movie i cant give you anymore information about this i guess youll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself 8 out of 10 stars
