now this is more like it the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid thoroughly enjoyable hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way throughbr br seriously this is just full of great stuff brimming with creativity and its less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time the scenes in hell are great and so are the ones in heaven theres really no shortage to the madcap adventurous romp that this one promises and you will never see another movie like this even the hammy final act of the movie isnt as bad as the first one being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family fun movie bliss and even keanu reeves despite looking about 30 isnt that bad herebr br sounds like a good deal to me
