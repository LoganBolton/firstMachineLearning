okay ill admit iti am a goofball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy while i have seen more films by kurosawa bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesnt try to be sophisticated but is simply funny a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail uhf start the revolution without me strange brew and the bill and ted movies they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike thembr br while bill  teds bogus journey isnt as wonderful as the original bill and ted film it still is great fun also unlike the original it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing i remember not loving the film the first time i saw itpossibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs but every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great momentsparticularly those involving the grim reaper and by the way this reaper is about as different from bergmans in the seventh seal as you can get in addition to a lot of laughs this film features some excellent musicone way that its actually better than the first film the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunesprovided you arent an old killjoy like de nomolos great viewing for kids and adults alike
