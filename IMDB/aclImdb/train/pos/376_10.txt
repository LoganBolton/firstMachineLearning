spielbergs first dramatic film is no letdown its a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an africanamerican woman it also proves that not all movies that have the africanamerican ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an africanamerican directorbr br what i love about this movie is spielbergs ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually hes just himself throughout most of his movies but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg she is excellent as celie you will never forget these characters once youve seen this moviebr br now i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope its about as good as this one is because this one is a film that shouldnt be missed
