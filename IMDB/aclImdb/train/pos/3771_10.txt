1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time terminator 2 judgment day and bill  teds bogus journey out of the two ive always liked bill  teds bogus journey a bit better terminator 2 judgment day is the better made but theres just nothing like bill and ted besides chris farley and david spade in tommy boy its hard to think of a greater comedic duo than bill and ted they are one of a kindbr br seemingly influenced by national lampoons oc and stiggs bill and ted were created by ed solomon and chris matheson two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in la back in the 1980s the two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long bill  teds excellent adventure was born the film shot in 1987 and released in 1989 became a big box office success and an instant cult classic it wasnt long before work began on the sequel stephen herek the director of excellent adventure wasnt keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too meanspirited and unlike the first one so peter hewitt making his feature film debut was brought in to direct the sequel there couldnt have been a better director for the job bill  teds bogus journey is marvelously directed its filled with its own unique style and energy that cant be matchedbr br what makes bogus journey one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original it is just as fun it doesnt change the characters like most sequels do bill and ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film this is because it was written by the original writers most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one but since bogus journey had the same screenwriters it ended up being just as good as excellent adventure if not even better just like the first one bogus journey is absolutely hilarious well written fun and above all original its filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from alex winter keanu reeves and william sadler its an unforgettable journey 1010
