my take a goofy yet imaginative mess br br keanu reeves yes that keanu reeves and alex winter return as the two punkrock idiots in this sequel to the timetrotting adventure comedy bill and teds excellent adventure now a cult classic in this sequel bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time they might as well travel heaven and hell too during the beginning of this sequel bill and ted are preparing for a battle of the bands competition which may make them more famous than ever meanwhile many years in a futuristic civilization the timewizard from the first film the always watchable george carlin is running a university praising bill and teds names there an evil tyrant joss ackland from the hunt for red october plots to get rid of the two idiot rockstars once and for all so he sends two identical android replicas in the words of bill and ted robot uss to do the dirty jobbr br there after bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell with inhabitants that happens to include the duos worst memories and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends and their show along this whackedout voyage they play board games with none other than death william sadler from die hard 2 reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and morebr br bogus journeys array of exuberant special effects gimmicks arent up to todate standards and even some of the humor and the forthetime look and feel are somewhat dated to be honest the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year even for the 90s but with its no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction bill and teds bogus journey is fun imaginative and yes bogusbr br rating 12 out of 5
