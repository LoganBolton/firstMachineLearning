it was only on my second viewing years later that i realized two things about this movie 1 i enjoyed it immensely and 2 that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protestsvalleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness even goodnatured airheadedness just arent inherently funny especially when drawn out to feature length but though the movies momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end reeves and winter and sadler and hal landon jr in an unforgettable scene display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsilyscripted jokes eg ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell work as effortlessly as the witter ones eg the challenge and the teaming of winter and reeves clicks so well that the teaming of bill and ted who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie disaster if theyre not wellmatched appears utterly unstrainedbr br side note i found the first movie to be only sporadically entertainingsightly different comic sensibilities there it seemsbr br i give it a 775 surprisingly good fun
