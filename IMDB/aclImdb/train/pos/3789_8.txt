bravo to czechs their oncepowerful movie industry seems to awaken from postcommunist slumberbr br the loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern hollywood production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years superb soundtrack excellent visual editing beautiful prague cityscape to mention but a fewbr br the story is actually comprised of several substories that frequently intertwain and overlap an is in essence a collage of destinies fates desires it follows a group of urban youthtomidthirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions and it is hillarious theres actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in about a 100 people in a small art gallery laughed nonstop for about 4050 seconds how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productionsbr br although the entire main cast is excellent especially the upcoming macedonian star labina mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the alltoofamiliar hardships i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situationsbr br conclusion dont miss this one its got a lot to offer
