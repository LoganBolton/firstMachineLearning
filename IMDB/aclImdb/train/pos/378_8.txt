these days spielbergs the color purple is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch whats even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasnt even nominated for best director needless to say the filmmakers deserved more acclaim than they were accordedbr br the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson whoopi goldberg an africanamerican woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celies relationships with the women around her its told from a decidedly female perspective but you neednt fear that its a saccharine chick flickbr br the story is an interesting one livened with humour at times although the central characters struggles are paramount some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the films end but i didnt mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyesbr br the film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg best actress oprah winfrey best supporting actress and margaret avery best supporting actress i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffedbr br as already mentioned spielberg didnt receive a best director nomination for his efforts such an omission beggars belief since spielbergs direction here is topnotch im not especially crazy about quincy joness score but its not below average by any meansbr br in the end the story is a satisfying one welltold by a master filmmaker working from pulitzer prizewinning material give it a try and youll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night
