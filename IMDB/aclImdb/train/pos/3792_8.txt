i saw this film earlier today and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didnt feel like a film  it felt more like a documentary the part i liked best the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen yearold girls i knowbr br all in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films
