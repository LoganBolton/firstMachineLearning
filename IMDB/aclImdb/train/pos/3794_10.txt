our song gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha maria and joycelyn  best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer adolescent summer  even if we dont know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain crown heights brooklyn  iswas the same for us all a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school welcome heat and idlenessbr br but if this experience of adolescence is universal the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know  maybe as foreign a country as any young bodies carving new silhouettesbeckoning new territorythe maze towards adulthood the young mind coming into itself speaking for itself saying this is who i am this is who i want to try to be it iswas always thus but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90sbr br jim mckay is the writerdirector of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him the opening title slide a film by seems to list everyone in the universe its a gesture but by the end of the film we know it to be a genuine one the closing titles also have some of the most onthemoney and appreciative credits ive read the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted mckays a modest leader who knows who is telling this story  its his three graces lanisha maria and joycelyn theyre the real thing their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality this aint no music video shorthand telling of teenage life it has the seriousness of the long unblinking starebr br hanging out with them we dont quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life we are witness to the modern math of teenage life  how its problems are interpreted calculated and summed and solved small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job  its the only way she gets to spend time with him we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood in a connected scene lanisha defends her dad to her mom and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return later the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams  and we remember how crazyfunny kids are and more tragically how realism hammers idealism these days and at the end maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livablebr br our songs greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship  how one day alive and enlivening that intimacy can in the next just turn and drift away its awful but thats just the way it is isnt it
