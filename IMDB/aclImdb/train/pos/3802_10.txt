dragon hunters has to be the bestlooking animated film ive ever seen it was jawdropping the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash their weird furry blue dog that pees fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler an impossibly immense dragon but honestly it doesnt even matter what the film is about because it is jawdroppingly gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike and there are forests of floating lily pads the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted storybook look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats some of the plot isnt too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotionevoking dialog makes this film spectacular
