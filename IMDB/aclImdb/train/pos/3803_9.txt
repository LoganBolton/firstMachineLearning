what people fail to understand about this movie is that it isnt a beginning middle and end it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long tv series so remember that when you all talk about how the world wasnt explored enough that was all done in the tv showbr br as great and stunning as the visuals are i think the spoilers argument between lianchu and gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie seeing characters i had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing and seeing gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while lianchu sharpened his blade was almost tearjerking br br then we got a total contrast with lianchu fighting these insanely awesome dragons which had been featured before in the series while gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill zoe shudder im surprised that this particular scene hasnt been mentioned more in the warnings any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that gwizdo wasnt himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl it was enough to bother me and im 15br br the world is amazing the plot is a lot better than most multimillion blockbusters and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go check it out
