this movie took my breath away at some points i simply loved it br br i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better but hey this is just a simple short story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon theres nothing more to itbr br the overall design atmosphere the beautiful landscapes its all just magical br br theyve put a lot of love in this movie character designs were great and funny a bit tim burtonish if you like i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design displayed in a simple small but lovely story
