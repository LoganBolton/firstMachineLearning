my first impression would be this is beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting grendel and dragons intact making it one thrill ride from start to end written by frederic lanoir and arthur qwak the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around which can either be wastelands or globes of greenerybr br the storys a simple one which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragons unwanted visit to plunder and destroy and the resident knights have all but been annihilated enter the kings granddaughter zoe marie drion who gathers lianchu vincent lindon a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant and his partnerinarms gwizdo patrick timsit who balances the partnership with his cunning brain lianchu and gwizdo together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free hence their career in monsterextermination which doesnt exactly pay offbr br thats basically the whole gist of it but what makes this film a spectacle is its cg graphics which is solidly rich detailed and an eyepopping marvel to behold it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action and during those fight sequences theres nary a boring moment photorealistic moments of nonexistent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of makebelief and its easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual threesuns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs heres having at you george and i couldnt get enough of the finale battle as well though the usual brickbats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle charactersbr br i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computeranimated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of pixars and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of zodiac the race begins and legend of the sea can learn from Â– to keep the story effectively simple and let your moving artwork do all the talking definitely highly recommended
