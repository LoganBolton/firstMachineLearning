have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon oh you have was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon i didnt think sobr br i stumbled onto this movie by accident and im really glad that i did its one of the most beautiful movies ive ever seen much like the pixar movies its a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in todays world the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen and this attention to detail is staggering the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in actionbr br although the plot may not be entirely unique the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching our protagonists are likable and interesting ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path of course hector is the character most will fall in love with a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream ofbr br in summary id recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity watch it for the incredible animation the breathtaking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world thats unlike anything else youve seen on a cinema or television screen at the very least its a fun way to spend an hour and a half  no matter if youre nine or twentynine which in fact i am
