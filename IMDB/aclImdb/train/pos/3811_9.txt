for a long time i havent seen so beautiful animated feature having healthy respect for pixar i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by em can not be compared to this animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here the graphics is amazing the background surroundings are mindblowing almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly sometimes i felt tingles down my spine  so much i loved what ive seenbr br the plot is absolutely romantic as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be the characters are lovable especially hector the blue rabbit he owns pawns rocks and rules the other chars are very nice also the humor is topnotchbr br generally it seemed that creators didnt invest much effort into this i mean it looked like it didnt take em too much in difference from people of pixardreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new and im very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great theyve made a magnificent touching movie a candy for eye and heartbr br the only minus is stupid beginning and thats why its 9of10 not 1010
