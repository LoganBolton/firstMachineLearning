initially i would have thought that secret sunshine had something critical to say of religion and here being christianity and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou surprisingly it was none of the sort and was largely nonjudgemental putting in place events as a matter of fact and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusionbr br and i cant help but to chuckle at the role of song kangho a man whos taken a liking for widower shinae jeong doyeon and starts going to church when she does the reasons for church going are many i suppose either to find inner peace to seek help being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of hell to reaffirm faith or even things like wanting to get married in a church or to skirt chase i kid you not but to each his own reasons for turning up in church every sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship what is indeed dangerous is when the underlying ulterior motives do not get satisfied and thats when frustration sets in or when you discover how hypocritical man can be portraying one face inside the house of god and displaying yet another outsidebr br shinae and her son jun moves to the town of miryang which is the birthplace of her deceased husband wanting to start life anew she opens up a piano shop to give lessons though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moments lack of good judgement has another tragedy befall her and that takes one hour to get to secret sunshine really took its time to get to this point where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with shinae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state reveling in the comfort that religion and fellow believers can offerbr br what began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind and sometimes you wonder if its because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everythings good going your way and in shinaes case her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways toobr br the last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty where most of us can identify with  why me and why not someone else as we rage against our faith and start questioning unfortunately with no hard and fast answers available it is then either we fall by the wayside or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously but somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in secret sunshine so as not to offend and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece got mutedbr br if you bite into the hype this movie is generating then perhaps youll realize only jeong do yeons excellent portrayal is worth mentioning as she totally owns her role as the widow shinae who is probably the most unluckiest person on earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time and if you look at it carefully most of which are of her own doing watching her transformation is worth the ticket price and despite having my personal favourite korean actor song kangho in the movie this is something he just breezed right through
