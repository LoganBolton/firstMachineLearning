the most interesting thing about miryang secret sunshine is the actors jeon doyeon as lee shinae the main character is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident and who leaves seoul to live in miryang which was his home town with her young son jeons face is very changeable she is girlish flirtatious elegant aged and sad desperate and joyous with it and terribly isolated by turns and its all in her face the film also stars song kangho as kim a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into miryang who happens to run a garage in town and who follows her around all the time thereafter despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions song is the biggest star in korea right now renowned for his work with park chanwook and bong joonho sympathy for mr vengeance memories of murder and the host and yet here he plays a throwaway character almost a forgotten man but of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing he is the essential ballast to keep jeons character from floating awaybr br lee shinae is a piano teacher she comes to the new town which is a neutral place a kind of poormans seoul a town just like anywhere else as kim says just as he is in a way just like anyone else her little boy is sprightly as little boys are but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too his father used to snore and when he misses him he lies awake pretending to snore he goes to school and shinae meets parents and students and shopkeepers there is a sense of place in the film even though the place is in a sense anywhere people speak in the local dialect and everyone knows everything and shinaes seoul origin is immediately noticed is life really harsher here away from the big city and its sophistication shinae seems not to realize the danger she is inbr br something terrible happens and shinae doesnt necessarily deal with it in the best possible way but it happens and she must face the consequences but she cant she goes to pieces a perpetrator is caught but thats no consolation eventually she becomes so despairing she relents and goes to a bornagain christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend she finds peace and release with this but when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again she becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion and it gets worse than thatbr br jeon doyeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role lee changdong may be a very good director if an actor of the stature of song kangho expresses enormous admiration for him that is convincing according to scott foundas of la weekly lees first three films green fish 1997 peppermint candy 2000 and oasis 2002 have marked him out as one of the leading figures of his countrys recent cinematic renaissance but this is not as successful a film as those of other korean directors whose work ive seen such as yong sangsoo bong joonho and the prodigiously almost perversely gifted park chanwook it may indeed begin as foundas says as a kind of asiatic alice doesnt live here anymore and then abruptly and without warning turns into something of a thriller and some time after that a nearly bressonian study in human suffering but that progression not only seems random and indigestible the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out with no sense of an ending there are also weaknesses in the action shinae takes foolish chances with her son and makes bad choices all along if she is destined for madness like betty in jeanjacques beineixs betty blue which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices that isnt something that is properly developed this is an interesting film certainly a disturbing one but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied after putting one through an emotional wringerbr br an official selection of the new york film festival presented at lincoln center 2007Â—an event that has done right by korean filmmakers in the recent past
