corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie in a coreen drama such as this secret sunshine youll also find some comical parts thriller scenes and romantic times theres not only tragedy in life theres also tragiccomedy says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by song kangho summing up the mixture of the picture but dont get me wrong this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators that doesnt mean that it lacks unity  on the contrary its rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in painbr br shinae whos in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband really gives by all the different faces of suffering shes going through unity to this movie its realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through denial lost anger faith pert of reality  the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experiencebr br the only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience the woman wears the mask of tragedy the man represents the comical interludes and to let the artifices of the movie touch you i must say that some parts of the movie really did move me especialy in the beginning particularly those concerning the unability of chang joan to truly help the one he loves but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end nevertheless some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing this kind of scenes makes secret sunshine the melo equivalent of the host for horror movies or memories of murder for thrillers these movies are indeed surprising most original aesthetically incredible and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with the only thing that secret sunshine forgets as the host forgot to be scary is to make its audience cry  bad point for a melodrama but good point for a good film
