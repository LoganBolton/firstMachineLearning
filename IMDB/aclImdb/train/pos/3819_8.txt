ive waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in istanbul film festival maybe because i expected too much from this film and thats why i was slightly disappointed i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth watchingbr br the subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long but there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another however the acting of jeon doyeon is incredibly beautiful it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldnt be that nice if she was not in the leading role
