i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for its pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience the story of onewomansstruggleagainstallodds is an old clich√© by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purplebr br it also showed a different side to the africanamerican experience  showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated white man and were abusive of their own people i find this an important point as it goes against the portraywhiteonblackviolenceandwinanoscar trendbr br also the acting performances are superb  especially oprah who i now have a new found respect forbr br well worth watching  but keep some tissue handy
