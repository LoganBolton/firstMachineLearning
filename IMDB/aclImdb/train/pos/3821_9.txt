all korean film festivals masterfully written and directed and uniquely photographed secret sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy this film also talked about the forgiveness of god and people lee chang dong director and writer of this movie said in an interview in a vast sense i wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense without love we cant talk about hope and salvation lee acknowledged that secret sunshine had no apparent genre this movie is not a movie about religion but it drew attention from many christians in korea because there were a lot of christian elements in the moviebr br the turning point in secret sunshine comes when jun shinaes son is kidnapped and killed the kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land she must be rich her lie causes much sorrowbr br shinae becomes a churchgoer and wants to forgive the murderer she decides to visit her sons murderer in prison and forgive him jongchan shinaes guy friend says just forgive in your heart do you have to go to the prison her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her her pastor agrees with what she wants to do that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action the result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in shinaes life the murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by god this sparks anger in her toward god she says how could you forgive the man before i forgive br br she begins to fight against god she looks up to the sky and proclaims i wont lose to you she becomes a snare her heart is a trap and her hands are chains it is more bitter than death she becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital on the day shinae is discharged from the hospital she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face the daughter of her sons murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair the murderers daughter has helped kidnapped shinaes son while she cuts shinaes hair the protagonist cant understand whats going on and gets out of the shop quicklybr br it is difficult not to talk about jongchan in the movie jongchan does his best to be by shinaes side although shinae doesnt care about him at all he is beside her all the time shinae leaves church quickly but jongchan who started attending church because of shinae stays there because he feels peace with god lee changdong the director of secret sunshine says that jongchan is like milyang secret sunshine the rural city or vice versa he seems to be too secular and frivolous but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her milyang is like him mr lee adds someone joked that jongchan could be an angel i think that he could be the angel who knows we cant say for sure that there is no angel if there is a person like jongchan who forever accompanies his lovers twists and turns we can defend ourselves against the overpowered the life of shinae is full of meaninglessness her husband died after he cheated on her and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husbands hometown and her soul was damaged because she learned christianity in a wrong wayÂ—and that makes her crazy literally it is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness does she still have hope in her life can she find meaning in her life the final scene gives us hope shinae tries to cut her hair by herself we walk our lifes journey by ourselves she however realizes that it is hard to do it by herself and we know that we cant do everything by ourselves we see jongchan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair thats her hope she has jongchan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is as i mentioned earlier jongchan is like an angel for her if we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives br br secret sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in korea it is like da vinci code while da vinci code helps us discuss the early church history secret sunshine prompts us to deal with lifes messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable with a shallow interpretation of the movie people misunderstand christianity and its theology with a deeper interpretation this movie will help us see beneath the surface some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched secret sunshine and lee changdong responds by saying they were already antichrist before they watched this movie secret sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through shinaes life
