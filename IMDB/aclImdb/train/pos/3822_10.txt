lee changdongs exceptional secret sunshine is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year it is an instantly sobering brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of smalltown dynamics lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realismbr br secret sunshine remains an immensely compelling fluid work throughout its 142minute runtime its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness adapted from a short story lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent oasis understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widows sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experiencebr br doyeon jeons you are my sunshine best actress accolade at cannes in 2007 is well deserved her performance as the widow shinae remains an unrelenting enigma as a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the films turbulent nature with jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another theres a tremulous sense of collapse that the film to its credit never approaches instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts she becomes the centre of the films universe as well as ours filmed in glorious handheld cinemascope the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from shinae through times of happiness guilt and remorsebr br lee captures the details of life in the small suspicious town of miryang Â– the awkwardness of communal situations its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas shinaes interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son jun seon jungyeop the one recurring acquaintance is jongchan song kangho a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to miryang in the films enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight song has situated himself as a comedic antihero in south koreas biggest films but his nuanced lowkey delivery here purports the directors thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessarybr br if pain is ephemeral then grief can never truly dissipate and lee finds complexity in subsistence when shinae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical christianity as a foil to her sorrow but lee knows better than that when he understands that religion in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery is never a simple solution but lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others the scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesnt allow itself to become aggressively scornful which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and charactersbr br lees first film since his call to office as his countrys minister of culture and tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering in a film so artless and genuine it arduously reveals that theres nothing as simple as emotional catharsis just the suppression and abatement of agony secret sunshine leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith
