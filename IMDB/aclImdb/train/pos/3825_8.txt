a young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident she barely settles down in this small town but shortly after loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes this could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie find a new partner and being happy finally or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself she does try to kill herself but not after a series of severe fights with god she trusts in god only to find that god seems to forgive everyone even the killer well i should be careful here about god the movie doesnt mean a thing against god the way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting not in the womans point of view or from gods perspective in this way there would be lots of grass growing clouds flying views i suppose rather its from a third partys eye the movie let us to perceive and doesnt explain a thingbr br the movie wouldnt be so interesting were there only the woman theres this man whos everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her but in his own way hes a funny guy like a clown i should say who shamelessly hangs around our heroine the combination of these two the woman full of tension crying and throwing up always and the man smiling and talking stupidly ends up in a good balance of emotions nothing absurdly wrong or too tediousbr br highly recommend
