i love korean films because they have the ability to really quiet eerily really capture real life i tend to watch korean movies just for that reason alone ive seen this directors other movies before the one that comes closest to the feelings i got from this is oasis and another awesome film called this charming girlbr br however my title summary is supposed to be from a chrstian perspective so ill just start doing that instead of just showering it with praisebr br for a non christian perspective director changdong lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern protestant church regardless of denomination warts and all ive always been waiting for a christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life because christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to many films with religious undertones though having good motives tend to just have the resonance of a disney film or after school special they need to show life as it is real people curse real people lust real people fall and though christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life and doyeon jeons character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found god but because of lifes bitter realities loses that love for him she once had she doesnt deny god exists it is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is an all loving and forgiving godbr br in her decent to the edges of morality and madness her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one religious or notbr br if god is love why does he allow such terrible things to happen this film doesnt answer that rightly so and i believe the last 10 minutes of the film though open to interpretation leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of secret sunshine full circlebr br i dont believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that there in lies the reason why it worked even more its real its honest and because of that it is by far the best summation of a real christian life i have seen on film
