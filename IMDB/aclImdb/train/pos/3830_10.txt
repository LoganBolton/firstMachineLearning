the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie we were watching it for alex winter of bill  teds fame we didnt know what to expect other than who and what it was aboutbr br by the time the movie was over we knew that it was love at first sight this movie while not completely historically accurate was and is the best one of its genre i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion none of the others can compare it fibbed a little at certain details but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good but none as captivating as this onebr br haunted summer has the qualities of a painting the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentrics home the costumes were gorgeous and despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the serenity that these historical figures found therebr br this movie shows besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of englands harsh judgements the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well yes there were drugs it was a fairly common practice during that time a time when drugs were not illegal and the taking of laudanum the liquid form of opium was medicinal as well as recreational shelley suffered from consumption lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer and they were poets during a time when experience was the key there was no time for prudish caution passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era and out of the thoughts and discussions of science religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend frankensteinbr br yes in this movie we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin not married to shelley at that time played by beautiful and talented alice krige she is the control factor to all that goes on until she too gives in to experience but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and fatherbr br the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played the music fitting the direction captured the essence of the summer as ive read about it this movie was based on a wonderful book haunted summer by anne edwards if you like this movie read the book the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this storybr br if you are a person who loves history even the little inaccuracies from time to time and romance and the gothic then this is a movie for you it shows the birth of the birth of the monster which even today teaches us about the morals of playing godbr br a definite must see movie
