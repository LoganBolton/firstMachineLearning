this an free adaptation of the novels of clarence mulford fans of the willaim boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here and the reviews here so far reflect that but i knew of hopalong from the novels first and never cared much for the boyd films once i got around to thembr br christopher coppola has made a wise choice  he has not made a nostalgic western instead he has approached the cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call americana or what older critics once called homespun as the film unraveled i found myself more and more reminded of the great hallmark theater version of mark twains roughing it with james garner narratingbr br both these films remind us that although films about the old west are probably always to be mythic for americans they need not be westerns they can very well be just films about what it meant to be american in that time in that placebr br i never feel pandered to watching this film theres no effort to shove the boydcassidy legacy down our throats no irony no camp consequently i get a sense of these characters as having walked  or ridden horseback  across some real western america i too could have walked a hundred years agobr br given that the plainness of the film  it positively avoids anything we have come to call style  is all to its favor and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this gosh it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive  no visual dressing just the quirks and good humor  and sudden violence  that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations he or she will find considerable pleasure in itbr br i would have given this film 9stars but ill give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely and i urge them to set their memories of boyd aside and give this film another chancebr br note 1 a reviewer complained that hopalong shoots people dead in this film rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ala boyds cassidy first cassidy does shoot people dead in the novels second if cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead  the problem with shooting guns out of peoples hands is that they can always get another gun  which happens to be part of the subtext of this very filmbr br note 2 i admit that i am jealous of the coppola family that they have the director of the godfather among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that i cant but a good movie is a good movie and this is a good movie if its by somebody by the name coppola well thats just is as it is america is the land of opportunity or was until bush got into office  thats what the great american novels are all about
