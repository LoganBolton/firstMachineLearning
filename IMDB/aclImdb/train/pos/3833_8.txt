i cant believe others took such a serious view of all this god it was a lot of fun rooting for hopalong cassidy it was a great tribute to the western serials of years ago it wasnt meant to be a great cinema experience except it was so what if there wasnt a big special effects bonanza it was a fun tongue in cheek look at old westerns man relax and enjoy
