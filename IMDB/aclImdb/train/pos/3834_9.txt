a great film slow yesbr br but original deeply atmospheric dark and horrifying perfectly surreal feels like a nightmarebr br id compare it to david lynch eraserhead inland empire blue velvet style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch insects also a bit of jodorowsky fando y lisbr br add some night on earth angel heart and a bit of begotten pi would it be wrong to mention tetsuo jacobs ladder barkers the forbidden and salome  that should form together at least the concept of a dark night nuit noirebr br if youre out for avantegardistic andor surrealistic cinema like i am youre gonna like this one if youre expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot  try your luck with something elsebr br final words the plot is very very strange and unusual and thats probably the 1 reason why most people who dont appreciate this film hate it
