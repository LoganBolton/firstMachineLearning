this film is amazing  its just like a nightmare the bizarre story the dark decors the swarming insects everywhere the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams really great people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic it seems a little to the films of david lynch the strange story the bizarre dreams the red curtains nuit noire contains almost no plot its rather a succession of surrealistic happenings nightmares and meetings thats a drawback if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement i would give it a 10 out of 10 but thats missing and thats why i gave the movie an 8 nuit noire is a film worth watching search that dvd and youll be rewarded
