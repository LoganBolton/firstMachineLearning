the fourth man paul verhoeven  netherlands 1983br br a film based on a novella by gerard reve that works best as a thriller thats quite surprising considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his workbr br the fourth man is topheavy on symbolism paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and im never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out in the fourth man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity of which theres plenty but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldnt get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes theres hardly a scene without sex or fullfrontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story br br nevertheless when you can cope with verhoevens pretty obvious satiric approach its quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round thom hoffman and jeroen krabb√© in particularbr br camera obscura  710
