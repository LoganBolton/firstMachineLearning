in its time this movie had controversy written all over it like most of verhoevens projectsbr br containing very graphic depictions deathscenes a parachute that doesnt open smack guys body on the floor a guy being eaten by a lion chomp teeth in the throat and a guy being run over by a speedboat zoom bloody corpse going downbr br but besides gore this flick also contains some brilliant and stunningly beautiful scenes filmed in the gray fishers town that is vlissingenbr br thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie a beautiful holy woman putting flowers in a milkcan surrounded by slabs of blooddripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters in a graveyardbr br the story is concluded in a frantic but fulfilling 10 minutes that dont disappoint and will leave you sighing a breath of reliefbr br of course with the pros come the cons some specialeffects are too overthetop and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gorefactor eg the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets also while the two lead actors jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters the character of herman portrayed by the rather uncharming thom hoffman just feels enormously underdeveloped making him hard to care for even after his tragic deathbr br ive done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie and as you can see its not easily summed up in words so do yourself a favor if you happen to find this movie somewhere watch it  and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece
