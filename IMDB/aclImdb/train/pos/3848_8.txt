gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination he is also homosexual and catholic prone to catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant or so it seems on a trip to flushing he is seduced by christine when he discovers that christines new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade hes been fancying from afar he decides to stick around after all enforced heterosexuality has its compensations then he realizes that christines previous three husbands have all died violent deaths did christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend herman going to be the fourth man verhoevens overheated overegged melodrama is a delicious blend of hitchcock and david lynch full of ott eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red a lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of gerards imagination the fun is in figuring it out also the fact that christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish gerard or the bullish herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her in fact its fair to say gerards comeuppance cant come soon enough super performances too from jeroen krabbe and renee soutendijk and easily verhoevens best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of scifi starship troopers
