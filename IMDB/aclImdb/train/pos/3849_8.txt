this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses i havent read gerard reves book on which the film is based but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat selfconceited poetwriter who gets his in a way  no spoiling here an antihero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as has he all this in a superbly packaged cinematography paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute gesellich dutch locations into a suspenseful filmnoir setting impressive work
