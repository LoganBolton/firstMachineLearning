viewing de vierde man aka the fourth man is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience its a very tight and intense psychological mysterythriller from netherlandss paul verhoeven he directed this film just before he got big with his freeticket to hollywoodmovie flesh  blood in a lot of usercomments on this site i noticed the mentioning of alfred hitchcock indeed this movie might very well be hitchcockian but i also noticed touches of early cronenberg the visceral flavors of david lynch surreal storylinked visuals and even roman polanski plotwise setup funny thing is that the movies by those directors i was thinking of while watching de vierde man werent made until after 1983 the year of release of the fourth man so go figurebr br very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by gerard reve this movie is based on gerard reve is also the fictional name of the main character a tormented writer played by jeroen krabbé balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word rêve is french for dream and the film does feature a lot of dreamlikenightmarish sequences often to that extend that you dont always know for sure if gerard is awake or dreaming himself could this be coincidence maybe its just me but i dont think so renée soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady in a rather demanding role she sometimes seems to be guilty of overacting in a subtle way but that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions proves again what an excellent actress she is i might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male  female nudity as well as some rather explicit sexscenes and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for verhoevens basic instinctbr br another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical referencesimages which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservativecatholic movements at the time of its european release either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing now someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about de vierde man one of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the virgin mary to resolve itself i myself have big issues with the way catholicism has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies but surprisingly i had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to the fourth man although the virgin maryaspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point i also had fun with it in a way i think the keyword as to why it didnt bother me at all is duality because this movie works on two levels although divine intervention might have resolved the plotline from the protagonists point of view on the other hand the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman and thats the fun part you never know for sure and then theres the question could it be that gerard reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come like receiving omens at one point in the movie gerard even tries to fool christine into believing he is clairvoyant the way he is playing christine in that particular scene is exquisite to beholdbr br so with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction de vierde man is a very much recommended viewing indeed especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film but make sure you see the original dutch version not the dubbed one
