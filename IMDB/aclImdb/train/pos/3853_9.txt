i dont know if id consider it a masterpiece of not but its damn near close its extremely well made artistic suspenseful intricately plotted thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexualreligious imagery theres also some great camerawork from jan de bont an atmospheric score from loek dikker and outstanding acting from jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk the latter giving one of the most sneaky subtle femme fatale performance ive ever seen like many other european movies this movie has an unashamed nonjudgmental attitude toward sex nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious andor surrealistic some would say blasphemous images in other words if you cant bear the thought of seeing a lustdriven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess it mixes the abstractsurrealparallel fantasyreality scenes and somehow makes it all work like any good mystery you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses there is not an outofleftfield resolution here the movie has direction theres no needless filler and once it concludes you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch i can almost guarantee you will love this movie hell if you have no idea who they even are you still might like itbr br im not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed but the films opening shot  through a web as a spider catches its prey  sets the stage as krabbé as unshaven smug bisexual writer gerard reve interestingly also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on crosses paths with a wealthy mysterious sexy woman named christine soutendijk melding androgynous stylings with simone simonlike innocencecuteness thats pretty unnerving who may be a literal black widow responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands the two become lovers and move in with one another but were led to believe through christines bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman  played by geert de jong  who may or may not actually exist something terrible is boiling under the surface when another of christines lovers the young and beautiful herman thom hoffman shows up at the house things take an unexpected turn and thats all you need to knowbr br the 4th man was a huge arthouse success in much of the world but didnt make it over to the us until 1984 where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association the most common video is the media release which has been horribly dubbed try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release since coming to america verhoevens career has had its ups and downs he has made a few decent films flesh  blood robocop and some lousy ones showgirls in fact verhoevens big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting junior league version of the fourth man soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets 1989 and eve of destruction 1991 were the best offers she was getting she headed right back home to the netherlands
