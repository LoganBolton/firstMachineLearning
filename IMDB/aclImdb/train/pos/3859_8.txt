paul verhoevens de vierde man the fourth man is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen it really was a pleasant surprise the story concerns bisexual writer gerard jeroen krabbe as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser christine ren√©e soutendijk but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery this really pulls you into the story you dont want to watch but you cant turn yourself away this is by far verhoevens best film maybe second only to robocop true the fourth man isnt for everyone some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous just ignore them but trust me if you watch for at least ten minutes youll be hooked this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition compelling controversial and thrilling i even like the spider metaphorbr br  810
