tsui harks visual artistry is at its peek in this movie unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this its that bad  made it difficult to watch at timesbr br this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that ive never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kungfu novels without a doubt this is one of the bestlooking chinese historical kungfu epic ever madebr br but alas tsui hark hasnt improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile his apparent obsession with the silly and overlylong depiction of the evil guys didnt help either to make it worse this movie is very badly cast they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kungfu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody adam cheng siuchow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely betterbr br i wish that someday zhang yimou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and storytelling poetry of zhang
