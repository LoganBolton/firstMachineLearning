this is an extremely dense somber and complicated film that unravels quite slowly revealing excruciating detail like the attention paid in a novel and watching this film is like watching a novel unfold while i didnt care for the narrator as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen and the lead summer phoenix is fabulous her innocence and naivete some might find implausible sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland i can buy that critique but shes still fabulous partially because shes unlike anything ive ever seen beforebr br this film is unbelievably beautiful filmed by eric gautier and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesnt ever show what youd expect its always surprising and despite its length the film never reveals more than it needs to at 163 minutes its extremely concise to a fault id say which is one of the wonders of this film its filled with brief moments which are simply stunning some of the best youre likely to see all year and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience the family moments are unique ian holm is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater hasnt been seen in films since cassavetes opening night or perhaps chaplins limelight but believe it or not this film is much less conventional i never knew where this film was going and now having seen it it still has multiple possibilities this is a powerful incredibly provocative film
