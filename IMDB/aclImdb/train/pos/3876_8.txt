the lovely danish actress sonja richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding herbr br richter plays anna an outofwork independentminded somewhat neurotic and perhaps suicidal actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchairbound muted aged father named walentin the great danish actor frits helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was madebr br spoiler alertbr br walentin refuses to respond to anyone until he confronts the gifted anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a selfimposed death sentencebr br writerdirectoractor eric clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son jorgen played by clausen has loving a father who has never accepted him the film sags toward the end but clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible anna can alter the course of a human life highly recommended sonja richters performance is alone worth the price of admission
