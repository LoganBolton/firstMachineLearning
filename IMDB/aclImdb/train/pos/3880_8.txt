well for starters this actually was the most elegant clausen film to this datebr br the mans always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them but i think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything hes made earlier his work has  in very black n white words  been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience and weve always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to saybr br in villa paranoia however for the first time he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget set in jutland  in the country  it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused and on top of that he himself manages to play a bd a true bd who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there and people therefore suffer bitterlybr br  id have to say its one of the best movies ive seen this year and im greatly anticipating his next
