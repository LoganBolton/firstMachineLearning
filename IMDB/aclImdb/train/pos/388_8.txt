and i love it lots of special effects and for a movie thats not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece im one of the guys who didnt understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch its definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a fraction of the budget of these international hitsbr br one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong the topic is exotic and original production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is greatbr br one of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope theyll continue working in this area until they surpass hollywood adventure moviesbr br just fantastic
