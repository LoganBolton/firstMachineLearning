this is an excellent standup dvd eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it i highly recommend this one the part about the history of europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in french are quite good because you dont have to speak french to get it although if you do it is still hilarious also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good the first scene about san francisco is not great but funny the first time skip over those if you can its almost not worth watching however this really is a funny funny standup show that everyone should see i was dead at the time
