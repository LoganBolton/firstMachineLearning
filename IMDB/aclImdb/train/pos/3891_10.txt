one of the best comedians ever ive seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more my friends and family quote from this dvd so often youd think we did nothing other than watch it the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage watch for the cake or death part joking about the church of england and the hitlerpol pot part hard to explain just watch it the best part of the show may be eddies facial expressions he can really say a lot with his eyes mascara eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help huh fair warning eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of fourletter words in
