this video was my first exposure to eddie izzard we had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channelsurfed to hbo during the course of the evening someone by the name of eddie izzard was oni tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes i didnt want to be held responsible for the rest of the groups enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me after holding in my laughs for more than was healthful i let goas did the others of uswe were not stoned by the way nor talking of insurance and pensions we were asphyxiated after that the story lines the plot the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance i have since been addicted to every eddieizzardpieceofcomedy i can get my hands on his work is sheer genius his comedy appears effortless he seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or thatits convulsively funny he gives you the impression that the joke is between you  and himself the only true aficionados of humor after all if you are disappointed in this video you have no sense of the penultimate in humoror humour as they say in the uk
