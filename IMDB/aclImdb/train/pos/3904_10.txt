in my opinion this is the best standup show i have ever seen i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill but i must say i think this is his best work i would say though if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live it is worth itbr br most of the time after seeing a standup routine a couple times the jokes start to get old but i have to say ive seen this show so many times that i literally have the entire thing memorized which yes i realize is kinda sad but every joke still makes me laugh this is truly a feel good showbr br dress to kill will never get old for me i own it and watch it anytime i need a good laugh
