ive seen this film at least 4 times since 84 and its still great every time i see it its a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful musicbr br this telling of carmen is a story within a story with each paralleling the other until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of spains premier flamenco dancers the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more powerfulbr br its independent movie making at its best and probably my all time favorite foreign film
