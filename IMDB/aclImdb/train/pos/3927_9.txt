ok first a correction to the tag posted on this movies main page abe lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie nor did he stop at his sisters grave the individual in question is ann rutledge who was a very close friend to lincoln in his new salem days some say that ann was in fact lincolns girlfriend but there is no evidence to support itbr br now there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this film hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun and young mr lincoln is no exception however the courtroom case that is in the film is based on a real event the accusation of murder against william duff armstrong and even though its largely fictionalized in this film with lots of name changes it will still have viewers riveted to the screen this is hollywoods golden age with drama at its finest and henry fonda gives possibly the best lincoln played by anyone
