my what a directors intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions young mr lincoln is filled up with some oldfashioned values which in retrospect despite its twodimensional portrayal is at least more respectably done than one might see in the pap in current cinema what makes it work so extremely well as it does in all its simplicity and grandeur is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the guise of a history lesson br br we all know of abraham lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the civil war got assassinated but as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic funny in the most unexpected places and a true gentleman hes not some superhero that can do no wrong which was fondas only apprehension to the part before signing on but a figure with possible flaws that are surpassed by his innate goodness and clear sight of right and wrongbr br its suffice to say that john ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying actually its a lie he does try but he makes it sort of effortless in the studio system he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously zanuck so he was pretty much left alone to his own succinct practices in editing in camera and not moving it around so as to not waver far off from the story its this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material as a kind of companion piece to the fullblooded americana in 1939 as seen in mr smith goes to washington only here its the law and not politics br br fonda is terrific in the lead his first with ford and never lets us loose sight of lincoln past the makeup and extra boost in the shoes fondas own personality in a sense as it would in grapes of wrath and my darling clementine comes out in the character of lincoln however unlikely it might be theres no one else from this period that could have played him then hes mature and wise but has the gumption to prove himself in this case of a convoluted hesawthatbutdidshe murder casebr br only in little bits and pieces like that final shot which superimposes lincoln walking down the road with his monument and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on seem pretty dated as far as the goals set out with young mr lincoln there were all met by ford and his crew and cast its not as hokey as one might think going in and its got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos
