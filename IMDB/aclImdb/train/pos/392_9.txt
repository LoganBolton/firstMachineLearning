the legend of zu as i saw it was a very interesting story i think many of the people who didnt like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film they were expecting something akin to star wars and it was not that joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked we all have a mountain of swords within us we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives we all have to face our own insomnia someday granted some of the narration was a bit confusing and some of the action got a little hokey at times but i think other points of the film easily made up for it id watch it again br br i dont know if theres a difference between the legend of zu which i saw in mandarin with english subtitles and zu warriors the dubbed usa version it might have been dumbed down for american audiences which really would have detracted from this film
