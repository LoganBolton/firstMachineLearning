its remarkable that for young mr lincolns supporting players ford cast lesser known otherthanstar actors this not only heightens his films focus on the central character of lincoln but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into lincoln as a man of his place and time a man embroiled as each one of us inexorably is in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them its not so much through fondas lincolns words and actions but in the faces the reactions of the supporting players that ford tells the story of the formation of the young lincolns worldview sense of place in society and polity and of how the people responded to mr lincolns words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heedingbr br give this a try instead of focusing on henry fonda next time you view young mr lincoln shift your focus to the supporting characters  you will i expect be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both lincoln and ford i like to suspect that fords storytelling through the supporting characters reactions to fondas lincoln may have appealed to david lean when he directed omar sharif in doctor zhivago in which its the supporting characters reactions to zhivago that actually tell about zhivago
