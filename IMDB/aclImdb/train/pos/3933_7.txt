the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good but still not work if the audience doesnt believe that the actor is portraying the person thats the main issue with young mr lincoln henry fonda gives a terrific performance but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as softspoken as fonda portrays himbr br this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront whether or not this was a true story i dont know but if it isnt then why tell it using lincoln as the central character never mind though in the film lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murderbr br theres really not much to the film and as a result it seems rather empty i wanted more story and character development the film is 100 minutes long but it doesnt feel like it there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd but they seem superficialbr br the acting is good all around but as i said fondas performance works as a character but not abraham lincoln i just dont believe that the real lincoln was that softspoken true he has a big voice when he needs to such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly the other performances are solid though especially alice brady as abigail clay the mother of the accused shes a nice lady who we can really feel for simple and uneducated yet very sweet we can see why lincoln wanted to help herbr br john ford seems to think of this film as an epic and at the time of its release it probably was but even then theres just not enough material to present it as suchbr br its a nice watch but not a classic
