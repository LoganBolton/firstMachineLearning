this film was not only one of john fords own personal favorites but also numbered directors sergei m eisenstein and bertrand tavernier among its highprofile admirers ironically ive just caught up with it myself via criterions recent 2disc set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on italian tv many years ago and again a few times on tv while in hollywood br br the film marked fords first of nine collaborations with henry fonda and is also a quintessential example of fords folksy americana vein a beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work the courtroom sequences and eventual revelation in its second half still pack quite a wallop apart from giving stalwart character actor donald meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorneybr br fonda is of course perfectly cast as a bashful inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become president fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film  most notably in franklin j schaffners the best man 1964 and sidney lumets failsafe 1964  and its surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of lincoln since in his view that was like playing god br br it is interesting to note here that ford had previously tackled abraham lincoln tangentially in the prisoner of shark island 1936 a superb but perhaps littleknown gem which has luckily just been released as a special edition dvd by the uks veritable criterion standin eurekas masters of cinema label besides i also have two more abraham lincoln films in my dvd collection which ive yet to watch and incidentally both were directed by d w griffith  the birth of a nation 1915 and abraham lincoln 1930  and had i not just received a bunch of films ive never watched before just now i would have gladly given them a spin based on my highlysatisfying viewing experience with young mr lincoln
