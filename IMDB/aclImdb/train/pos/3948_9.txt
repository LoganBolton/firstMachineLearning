so finally i know it exists along with the other uk contributors on here i saw this on what must have been its only uk screening in the 70s i remembered the title but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people it scarred me thats 2 rs but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror then isnt that what a truly classic horror movie is all about i can barely remember the intricacies of the movie but what i do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white again if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this please get in touch
