i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again for the life of me i couldnt remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy thinnes movie credits excellent dark and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as crowhaven farm dont be afraid of the dark and satans school for girls all lost satanic classics i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwoods classic high plains drifter why dont they release these great little movies especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at walmart most of these flicks have a cultfollowing so sales shouldnt be a problem
