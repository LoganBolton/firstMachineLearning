whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie ive ever seen i invariably reply black noon and to this day nobodys ever heard of itbr br i watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhsbr br if anyone can trace a copy please let me knowbr br if i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film
