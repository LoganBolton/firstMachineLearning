this isnt among jimmy stewarts best filmsim quick to admit that however while some view his film as pure propaganda im wondering whats so wrong with that yes sure like the tv show the fbi this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support but as entertainment goes it does a good job plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and commies instead its a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart then its pretty certain the acting and writing were goodas this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasnt about to waste the star in a thirdrate flick so overall its worth seeing but not especially great
