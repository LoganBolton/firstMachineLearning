br br have you ever felt like your being watched like someone keeps tabs on every move you make well just remember before you decide to break the law the fbi will always be there at least thats the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama the fbi story it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world in 1959 by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents chip hardesty james stewartbr br chip was with the fbi from day one and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world even occasionally his family the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent and how being one affects his personal life the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots go undercover to solve an indian murderestate scandal bring fugitives into custody rescue hostages and helped fight in wwii he even helped bring communist spies to justicebr br stewart in a vaguely complex performance is stellar as always as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chips family life and his job we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son we also observe his wife having a miscarriage and his marriage having rocky times almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job vera miles gives a spotty performance but its very convincing none the less she was never a brilliant actress but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her well maybe thats just me sadly none of the other performances are worth mentioning but the attentiongrabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interestedbr br the cinematography of this film was impressive especially the scenes in the south american jungles the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroys fabulous direction every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story its chock full of ingenious camera shots some with a very hitchcockian feelbr br all in all the fbi story is a spectacular but overlooked film clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one i enjoyed jimmy stewarts spectacular performance and the captivating story
