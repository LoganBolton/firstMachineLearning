if you lived through the 60s this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous its all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out dont speak too soon for the wheels still in spin for the times they are achangin while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and its dissemination at the time that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia influencing engineers scientists and aiding in the hyperdevelopment of computer related activities a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there  youve captured the era better than ive seen before
