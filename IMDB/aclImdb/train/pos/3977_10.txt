i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60s and 70s it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like youre in on a secret and nodding your head at the same timebecause it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from 60spresent day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed whats in all 4 segments so just wanted to be safe
