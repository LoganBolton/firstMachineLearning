i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind you cant top a person with a strong style of movie presence a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayedbr br the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new millenium update we could see tsui harks vision of the zu mountains spectacular visual designs amazing actionfantasy epic made beautifully well kept me glued through the entire picture great cast with just fine acting its truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weirdbr br now the down side is people will definitely get confused with its broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie youll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself some can complain there isnt too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by handtohand wouldnt really make sense at all br br i appreciated this nice stylish picture it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui harks time  tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome tsui hark always attracts something different into hk cinema american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this aint no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre although it may not be a masterpiece but its special effects is truly better than storm riders this is really worth checking out
