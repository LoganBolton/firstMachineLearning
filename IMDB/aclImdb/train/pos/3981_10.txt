this is my fourth joe mcdoakes short that ive seen and so far the funniest one in this one joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating charles boyer and ronald colman when he goes to warner bros studio the company behind this series incidentally he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused then he encounters actor george ohanlon whos also mcdoakes who speaks in his more normal voice thats not too far from his later geroge jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director ill stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in picutres
