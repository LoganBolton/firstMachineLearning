watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance the blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey as i tuned in theres the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory  played by daniel craig no less  so the plot was immediately apparentbr br it turns out that eponymous mothers carpenter love interest is also the daughters boyfriend so theres trouble brewing and not too many surprises but id been caught by anne reids compelling performance and i was hooked the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves when she exudes sadnessbr br the sex scenes were fascinating and taboobreaking shouldnt older womens bodies remain covered up not here and were treated to a delicious reawakening in the mothers sexuality even more startling are the drawings shes made that spoiler once discovered confirm her daughters suspicion that somethings going on herebr br cathryn bradshaw as the daughter didnt convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast but that could be me with her waves of preraph locks i kept expecting to see julia sawahla whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind bradshaw has a rounder happier face that didnt carry the anger that emerges as the film progressesbr br the ending is weak if the goodbyes for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some closeups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons whatever shes done shes a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years and i found the lack of sympathy jarring for a film so full of emotion and be warned its like opening champagne youll never get the lid back on the ending is a cold contradiction
