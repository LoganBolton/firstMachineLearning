the mother is one of those films that you know is good maybe even great but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid  too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested inbr br the story is potentially distasteful in many ways the death of a character within the first half hour the decembermay romance the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirtysomething characters the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 but is a throw back to a collection of british usually madefortv movies from the late 1980s  it has a moral severity that never lets up which produces an enveloping throbbing angstbr br the mother is flawless but that is in part the problem if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws  inconsistencies of script some lesser actors  it takes the edge off but if such a film is so pitch perfect the experience of watching it is raw and painful even the technical qualities  lighting editing etc  make the viewer ache the london in this movie is bright and open filled with harsh cutting lightbr br if you are tough as nails or are one of those supersensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gutwrenching sad movies or novels then you will enjoy the mother anyone in between give it a miss or be prepared to squirm and be warned as tough as the movie is from beginning to nearend the worst is to comebr br toward the end of the movie the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it for having slept with her boyfriend and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her the mother agrees to this they both stand up and  instead of a well primed slap  the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxers blow argh
