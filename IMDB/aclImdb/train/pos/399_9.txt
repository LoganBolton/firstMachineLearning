this movie is very cool if youre a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology i realize many critics have called this film plotless i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven  earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the us even though it was purchased for us distribution along with crouching tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey well worth the search this dvd is also worthy of owning
