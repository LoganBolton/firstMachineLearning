this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity anne reid previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including dinnerladies a victoria wood scripted series on incompany catering workers if youre wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may a late60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an innerlondon borough her husband toots peter vaughan dies on their visit to the male of the latter species bobby and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by bobby and his family mays teacher daughter paula cathryn bradshaw lives nearby however and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london she is able to stay in paulas house and do some childminding of paulas more appreciative offspringbr br it is on mays visits to bobbys house that she embarks on an affair with darren a mid30s friend of bobby who is working on a house extension in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it it is may and not darren daniel craig who initiates the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect there is no explicit sexual content at least in the dvd i saw differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula a recent convert to therapy and selfexploration who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her paula is also darrens lover and when she finds mays explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion only in an english film perhaps could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother politely ask her to stand up and duly wallop herbr br in the mean time may is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of paulas writing group the contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with darren is clearly made it is at that point that may starts to acquiesce to paula and darrens worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride so may finds herself superfluous to both of her childrens needs and finally does return home but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures newbr br the films strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parentsibling relationships where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had noone to care for them this is not new but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over60s may well be the darkness of the films content from a screenplay by hanif kureishi stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit it seems to be perpetual summer and the overall mood is uplifting  it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy england the ending is perhaps underwritten as we dont know where may is going or for how long  perhaps shes shirley valentine with a pension shes certainly no picasso anne reid is however revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever like julie andrews in torn curtain said by paul newman there goes your mary poppins read dinnerladies image for goodbr br  yes he announced oct 2005 as the new james bond
