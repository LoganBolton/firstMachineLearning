warning contains spoilersbr br i have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy she came to mind when i reflected on the audiences reaction to the mother br br people gasped when may anne reid writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover darren daniel craig or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sexbr br screenwriter hanif kureishi my beautiful laundrette my son the fanatic again proves why hes among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the atlantic his storys not easy to take this searing family drama isnt a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because its raw complex and often makes us very uncomfortable nevertheless its powerfully good stuffbr br kureishi and roger michell who directed notting hill of all things craft an unsentimental wrenching and superblyacted portrait of an older woman who realizes after all these years she can and should still enjoy all of lifes pleasures in a wonderfully epiphanous moment when her son bobby asks her not to be difficult may shoots back why notbr br why not indeedbr br anne reid deserves an oscar nomination for her turn as may its subtle restrained powerful and sad often all at the same time watch reid when may observes darren and paula cathryn bradshaw in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub or when she begs paula to open the front door after a disastrous date reids eyes and face reveal all of mays anguish and despair in the films most devastating moment may drops to her knees before darren willing to do anything for him only asking him to be kind this is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actressbr br i enjoyed michells use of natural sound especially when may and toots first arrive at bobbys place it perfectly illustrated the cacophony around may and toots the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes thembr br this film at times reminded me of the honesty and rawness of mike leighs work except the mother hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloatbr br my one quibble michells decision to give may and darrens first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility the lovers remain out of focus while in the foreground a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze and the only sound is of may in the throes of passionbr br the problem with michells approach is that both reid and craig who completely envelops the role of darren plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that its unfair to hide their characters almost primitive energy from the audience especially since michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceralbr br this film doesnt have immensely likable characters we sympathize with may but she too causes her daughters suffering but i doubt kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk his point i believe was to unmask a family thats already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens its unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable
