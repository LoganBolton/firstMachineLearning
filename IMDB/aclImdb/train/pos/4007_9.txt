a fierce shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote my beautiful laundrette this is the best thing hes done since then its about intelligent people whose lives dont add up to much theyve squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion this is a film in which people and places feel familiar where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen in some respects its a bit like sunday bloody sunday but its an altogether tougher piece of work the director roger michell allows scenes to build instinctively and it is beautifully actedbr br as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture there is not a false note in her extraordinarily livedin performance and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi hasnt tapped into if the film strikes a false note it is perhaps in the character of the talentless daughter caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces or should that be the other way round and even messier life but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless the film is also extremely beautiful to look at dop alwin kuchler and must rank unhesitatingly as the best british film of the year
