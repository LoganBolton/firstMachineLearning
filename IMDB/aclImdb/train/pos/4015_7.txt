one of the more satisfying western allitaliana johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat intelligent cinemabr br johnny yuma is in most respects not terribly original but this actually does not count against it the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audiences expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements earlier pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle or major twist that provide continuing interest the quality of the execution is also obviously important a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audiencebr br given these criteria johnny yuma succeeds there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films the setting is the brutal twisted semifeudal twilight world of shared by many of the best gothic family westerns made 19641968 such as tempo di massacre 1966 the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars 1964 plot and the ringo films a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the 1960s70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors directors and screenwriters in the fod plot the protagonist arrives in town stirs up a tense situation then undergoes a neardeath followed by a resurrection in some films like quella sporca storia nel west 1968 it is quite literally a crucifixion the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing especially given the implicit populistexplicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films the ringo plot developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community with a healthy dash ironic uncertaintybr br the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of mancomortimer from a fistful of dollar 1965 the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two numerous films including da uomo a uomo 1968 or even el chuncho quién sabe 1967 use this relationship between an older and younger man fatherson olderyounger brother anglo adviseradversary and peasant revolutionary as a central dynamic to the plotbr br additionally there is the focus on deception and misdirection mazes and mirrors that recur throughout the best early wai the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mousebr br what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriris use of visualpsychological space together arrangement with the scripts intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible thought there are exceptions such as the cynical commentaries in django 1966 or faccia a faccia 1967br br psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery its juxtapositions and its description of the overall narrative situation see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the roof or from the background of the action or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch hotel even bedroom this again is a theme from fod finally note how there is a focus on the search for information like many elements this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hardboiled mystery novel red harvest it is through incidental contacts wanted posters overheard conversations glances out of windows watches left in the dust or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to its conclusionbr br the movie was notable in its time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence of course these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed which is to say that it was not the violence but its meaning that had changed johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in its use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the filmbr br what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site a shard of cruse pottery or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence lives that were significant simply because they existed while johnny yuma has intrinsic worth much of its interest for me derives from this connection and mysterybr
