the tenants began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased bernard malamud  writerphilosopher  examining the conflicts between jews and african americans in the incendiary atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written as a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real as transcribed into a screenplay by novices david diamond and danny green who also directs it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final momentsbr br harry lesser dylan mcdermott is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his newest book ten years into the writing convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn tenement owned by levinspiel seymour cassel who constantly tries to buy out harrys lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished into this atmosphere enters another black militant quasiantisemitic writer willie spearmint snoop dogg whom harry befriends hides and offers help to the nascent novelists attempt to write about the death of all white people harrys attempts to help willie lead to conflict not the least of which is harrys meeting willies girlfriend the white jewish irene bell rose byrne at a less than friendly gathering of willies militant black brothers and sisters willie and irene are on the skids and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel when willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by harry willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers the ending reveals the slippery nature of the human condition and the human capacity for violence and undoingbr br the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters the cinematography enhances the story keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings the film in the end is worth watching at least it attempts to recreate malamuds bizarre look at life in the big city grady harp
