i was very fond of this film it kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen one of the better movies about the partition that i have seen urmila matondkar is gorgeous too this is one of the most personal and downtoearth films ive seen on the partition its a little less mainstream than gadar and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on and come out completely one the other side this isnt typical bollywood fare but rather an arthouse type film the best part of this movie is that it doesnt dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another it doesnt blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things
