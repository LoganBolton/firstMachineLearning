a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam urmila and manoj bajpai have given their bestbr br there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through it looked like bollywood finally gave away its glamor and had some quality artists performing on screenbr br content wise the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in ones life goes beyond religionbr br the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodramabr br i simply loved it
