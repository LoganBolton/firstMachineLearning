i come to pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here im relatively new to bollywood films and was born and raised in the us so i dont have a broad basis for comparing pinjar to other indian films luckily no comparison is neededbr br pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiecebr br in one line i can tell you that pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time on a massappeal scale it could have been the indian equivalent of crouching tiger hidden dragon had it been adequately promoted in the us this could very well have been the film that put bollywood on the american map the american moviegoing public has a longstanding love affair with gone with the wind and while pinjar doesnt borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities not the least of which is the whopping by us standards 183minute run timebr br set against the gritty backdrop of the indiapakistan partition in 194748 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating put into an untenable position she somehow manages to not only survive but to grow  and even flourishbr br if the story is lacking in any way its in the exposition puros the protagonist growth as a person would be better illustrated  at least for western audiences unfamiliar with indian culture  if her characters back story were more fully developed in the early part of the film but that would have stretched a 3hour movie to 3 12 hours or perhaps even more because not one minute of the film is wasted and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remainsbr br i could use many words to describe pinjar poignant disturbing compelling heartwrenching come to mind immediately but uplifting is perhaps as apropos as any of those any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such and puros triumph  while possibly not immediately evident to those around her  is no less than inspirational for strength of story alone i cannot recommend this film highly enoughbr br equally inspiring is urmila matondkars portrayal of puro all too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger newer actresses urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays she doesnt merely act puros part she breathes life into the character manoj bajpais selection as rashid was inspired he manages something far too few indian film heroes can subtlety his command of expression and nuance is essential to the role he brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the swordwielding rioters combinedbr br if you only see one bollywood film in your life make it pinjar
