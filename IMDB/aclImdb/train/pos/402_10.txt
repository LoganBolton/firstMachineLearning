i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in chinas mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension thank that to tsui harks extensive use of cgi effects hes able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orbbr br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching in the beginning i like how she resembles the countess from zu warriors and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that cecilias very appealing to the eyebr br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema
