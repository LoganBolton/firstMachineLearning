this movie was absolutely wonderful the prepartition time and culture has been recreated beautifully urmila has given yet another brilliant performance what i truly admire about this movie is that it doesnt resort to pakistanbashing that is running rampant in movies like gadar and loc with the partition as a backdrop the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong the movie always centers around the tragic story of urmilas life her fragile relationship with manoj bajpai has been depicted excellently the movie actually shows how the people both hindus and muslims have suffered from this partition the theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film
