as jack nicholsons directorial debut drive he said displays at the least that he is a gifted director of actors even when the story might seem to lose its way to the audience and to a modern audience  if they can find it which pops up now and again on ebay  it might seem more free formed than they think the film contains vivid interesting characterizations the film tells of two college kids the protagonist is hector william tepper in what borders on a breakout performance a star of the leopards the college basketball team he plays on while he has to deal with a coach bruce dern who puts on the pressure to stay focused and a on and off girlfriend karen black with her own emotional problems theres gabriel michael margotta the other kid gabriel it seems is just a little more than freaked out by the possibility to be drafted and so in his own radical mindstate he does what he can to keep out but as hector tries to find the balance between his oncoming fame and those he loves gabriel is going over the threshold of sanitybr br nicholson on the technical side of things displays a fascinating editing style that keeps things on edge during the basketball scenes and implements darkness in many other scenes with a documentaryfeel throughout and from tepper black and even robert towne writer of chinatown last detail and mission impossible among others who rarely acts he garners some credible acting work though in tepper there is a tendency to downplay his emotions in some scenes for example when he could act brilliantly sarcastic he doesnt play it for what its worth from margotta on the other hand there is a vibrant twisted force in his performance and as he descends its frightening but perhaps understandable from the times and what a climax dern steals most of his scenes by the way in a performance that should have garnered him an oscar nomination every line of his dialog is appropriate true and its never hammed up like in recent coach movie performances br br but what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters arent explained to the degree one might wish more the film was based on a novel by jeremy larner who cowrote the script with nicholson and i was expecting that the film to be longer than it was its a slim volume with a lot of information about the times about the sport about the underlying feelings that were with those of the younger generation nicholson presents us with these characters and situations and rarely are they shown to whats motivating them the antiwar protesters not included their parts understandable enough gabriel is perturbed by whats going on in vietnam but what else is there hector too is a guy who has apprehensions about being drafted for the nba and he still loves to play but whats holding him back this whole atmosphere is intriguing how the late 60s collegebasketball experience was but that intriguing quality which does lead to some unconventionality is kept at a point where it cant go too further overall the effect of the film as a whole is bittersweet and somewhat memorable for its good points and not for its low ones and for sure you can tell whos behind the lens every step of the way b
