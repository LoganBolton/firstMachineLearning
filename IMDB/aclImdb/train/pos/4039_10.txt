most complaints ive heard of this film really come down to one thing it isnt versus yes the cast and crew is basically the same yes kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the films second half but thats about where the similarities end versus takes place essentially all outside showcasing kitamuras ability to craft an interesting bmovie in natural locations for alive almost everything takes place inside in small cramped spaces here the art design is thrust into your face and what art design it is we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces also a key difference is that we dont get much action here until the end of the film versus was all about action and cool here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind because of this alive is a far more interesting film than versus you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting charactersbr br im now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay you should too but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus  its often slow and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release
