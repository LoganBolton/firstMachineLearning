an inventive suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms not completely successful but taut surprising and wellacted one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw  two men trapped in room and pitting against each other  but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film its like watching a lab experiment some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system just right for a late night movie fest when one is in the paranoid mood it certainly kept me awake that night
