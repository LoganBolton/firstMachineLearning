the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chairbr br  then our hero who is called tenshu is taken to the chair hes zapped and thenhes still alive aha  he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool  either we zap you until weve made sure youre actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story commencesbr br  he wakes up in a different sort of cell very hightech and very big where he finds another cellmate who also managed to survive the electric boogieride a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish as long as it happens within that room sounds a little suspicious but the two men accept  what else can they do br br  what these two men do not know is that they have been set together so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them basically the unknown scientists in the background ps them off until they decide that they should kill each other sounds weird  indeed but theres a greater purpose to all of this this is the part which should not be revealed and so it shall remain unrevealedbr br  but fear not it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudoaction movie fore it has an entirely different approach to the question  how long time can you stand being with a man whos an sob and would you kill him to obtain freedom br br  the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest it sneaks up without you actually knowing it then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrixlike action fightscenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based uponbr br  the movie is indeed very special so special that normal cinemas wont view it under normal circumstances however the story is fascinating the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit some more than others to make the movie truly uniquebr br  if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cashbr br
