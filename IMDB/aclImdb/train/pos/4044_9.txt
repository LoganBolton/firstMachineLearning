i found this movie to be very wellpaced the premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer i was pulled along as the characters developed the pacing is done very well for those that like to thinkenough is kept hidden from the viewer early on and questions keep arising which are later answered producing a wellthought out and very satisfying film both cerebrally and from an action standpointbr br it seems some people were looking for a nonstop rollercoaster ride with this filmone of those that comes charging out of the gate this would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hillcreating a wonderful sense of anticipationand is ultimately in my mind more fulfilling for the foundation initially laidbr br excellent film
