i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the us to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the directors debut production conan in fact pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conanwho jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputathe only exception may be the robot unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism if it has a theme at all its antiwarfare the importance of living naturallythis is related with the flying castle is dismissably shortly discussed and not really followed through overall i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feelgood and corny
