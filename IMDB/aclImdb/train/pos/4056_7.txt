saw this on sbs tv here in australia the other week where it was titled laputa castle in the sky i had enabled subtitles and i think sbs provided their own for that which as usual was of very good qualitybr br just looked up laputa on wikipedia and it confirms what i suspectedthe floating island of this tale is taken from the classic jonathan swift novel gullivers travels which was published in the early to mid 1700sbr br anyway this is an engaging japanese fairytale which features an english speaking voicecast its suitable for young children i think but it does run at just over two hours in length so it may be too long for some though not for an adult like mebr br the story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it the children are not the only ones looking for this island they have pirates the army and spies looking for the island too and looking to capture the children sheeta the girl voiced by anna paquin and pazu the boy voiced by james van der beek in order to help them find itbr br the graphics are magnificentsort of photorealistic at times especially the scenes of stonework lit by torchlight or the pretty scenes of bright sunny days with white clouds or mistbr br recommended
