like many americans i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw spirited away i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki one of his earlier works is castle in the sky although its still enjoyable its not as good as spirited away though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfairbr br a young boy named pazu james van der beek is working in a mine late one night when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky when she wakes up the next morning she introduces herself as sheeta anna paquin but sheeta has a secret and before he knows it pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates the army and a lost floating citybr br going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing a sense of wonder and magic many filmmakers have tried but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhoodbr br because the film is animated dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words it also helps that the translated dialogue is wellwritten and voiced by talented actors the voice acting is varied james van der beek fares best he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta shes frightened by the events going on around her but she knows what she has to do mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska hes dangerous and wants something from sheeta and will do anything to get it the other voices are bad cloris leachman is awful as dola leachman may have won an oscar for the last picture show but shes annoying as the pirate leader leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk thats nearly always monotonous its so bad it nearly ruins the film jim cummings is an effective voiceover actor but hes miscast as the generalbr br i would definitely recommend seeing castle in the sky ill probably end up buying it myself but even though its not as good as spirited away its still pretty good
