retitled from its original japanese name of laputa for being an offensive phrase something which director hayao miyazaki was oblivious to at the time castle in the sky is the master animators third film and its one of his most beloved of all time initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world inspired by jonathan swifts gullivers travels castle in the sky is a steampunkthemed action adventure tale about two young orphans  young miner pazu and mysterious girl sheeta who wears a magic crystal around her neck  who team up to find the longlost island of laputa which is rumored to have great riches and gems they are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty dola who at first chase them yet turn out to be true allies and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmostsecret agent muska who wants the power of laputa for his own benefitbr br for anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours this film is an excellent choice featuring just the right amount of humor exploration wonder and mystery to keep one interested the artwork although not as spectacular as in some of miyazakis later movies is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations incredibly exciting action scenes and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy and while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than miyazakis other works each has a memorable endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over dola in particular makes for a terrific comic character shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of sheeta the next muska is one of the few miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain but like dola he commands every scene hes in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chillybr br anime fans have often compared this movie to gainaxs scifi adventure series nadia the secret of blue water after all both works share similar story and character elements not to mention that they were both created by miyazaki himself where both differ is in their execution nadia although charming for the most part suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot even though it did have a strong ending castle in the sky on the other hand remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time and is all the better for it while the films epic tone is sometimes broken up by some cartoonish moments like a brawl between pazus boss and one of dolas sons its never to the point that it detracts from the filmbr br about eleven years ago disney released an english version featuring a cast of bignames such as james van der beek anna paquin cloris leachman mark hamill mandy patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as tress macneille and jim cummings it also features an ambitious reworking of joe hisaishis gorgeous musical score for a performance by the seattle music orchestra interestingly the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself as much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore miyazaki had no such problems in fact he is said to have applauded the reworking and for good reason because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub while there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original japanese is a bit jarring notably the journey through a dragoninfested storm cloud the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end here hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals br br as far as the performances in the dub go the leads are probably at the short end of the stick james van der beeks pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character while anna paquins sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times a problem which actually works in favor of the character that said both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout its the lively supporting cast however that really make this dub so much fun particularly cloris leachmans dola and mark hamills muska both are perfectly cast and steal every scene theyre in as with the rescore these two really warrant a listen to the disney dub the script adaptation borders on the loose side at timestheres quite a bit of extra lines andor commentary some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdonebut aside from at least one debatable alteration sheetas speech in the climactic showdown the world cannot live without love as opposed to the original you cant survive apart from mother earth the overall characters story and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original on the whole there is little point comparing the disney version to the original language track each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece and i like them both theyre also better than streamlinejals more literal but frightfully robotic lifeless abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980s dont believe anybody who says this version is superior to disneystrust me the opposite is true br br either way though you cant go wrong with castle in the sky its one of miyazakis alltime greatest and i highly recommend it
