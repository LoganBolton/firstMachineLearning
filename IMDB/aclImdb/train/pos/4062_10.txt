i just realised ive been using imdb for years now and ive never reviewed my favourite film by favourite i dont mean something i like for now i mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it this is obvious because i am never going to be a child again i saw this film on itv in the early nineties i was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at im also male the gender that this film is intended for the overwhelming majority of miyazakis protagonists are female consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and i am forever indebted to carl macek sp for producing the english dub of this film which is far superior to the diney production which is not even funny  ive never even been able to watch that one  of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the macek version is so good the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original japanese actors that this version is available on the japanese dvd its not available on any distribution in an englishspeaking country go figurebr br there are hundreds of competent reviews so im going to put some trivia here not that im the definitive archive of information for this filmbr br first up id like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review miyazakis films  they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on imdb combined pale into insignificancebr br the fascinating story with this film is that miyazaki based the countryside around slags ravine pazus town area on the welsh mining communities he visited wales for a few months in the early 80s might be late 70s just after one of the great mining strikes being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight the fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man the countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where i grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest british islesbr br the island is of course from swifts genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century  the story in swifts book is deliberately ridiculous in castle in the sky miyazaki weaves together myths such as atlantis and the tower of babel  i think the architecture in addition is based on peruvian ruins though im not sure someone told me thatbr br anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film really will want to check out miyazakis epic series mirai shounen conan  future boy conan  based on the short sci fi novel the incredible tide by alexander key novel is available online conan is basically a prototype for laputas pazu and shita in addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for masterpiece theatre  some of his key frame animation he also did key frame for sherlock hound  this has some of the finest backgrounds ive ever seen too also check out miyazaki and takahatas first feature film horus prince of the sun 1968  amazing by todays standards in fact what else gauche the cellist and the flying ghost ship  though theyre pretty rarebr br this film is such a gift i dont know what wed do without it with all this other crap storytelling around this is like an oasis arigatou miyazakisensei
