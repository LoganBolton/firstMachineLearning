castle in the sky is undoubtedly a hayao miyazaki film after seeing it for the first time im glad to say that it doesnt disappoint on the contrary you get your times worth which means as to what miyazakis films are concern that is nothing less than excellent br br produced early in his cinematic career castle in the sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies with strong but young female characters forced to grow up due to external circumstances helped out by very interesting and some times lovable supporting characters and of course the usual battle of nature versus civilization flying machines lots of it beautiful painted sceneries  but alas no pigs  at least that ive noticed after all i have only seen it once never the less miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier with nausicãa which was a dress rehearsal for princess mononoke his magnum opus castle in the sky is set a bit a part from these two with a soft action packed first 30 minutes resembling his tv series conan and his directed episodes of meitantei holmes in here we are introduced to sheeta a girl who literally falls from the sky only to be found by pazu a young boy working in a little countryside mining town intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of laputa pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates as the movie progresses the plot gets heavier and much more interesting revealing myiazaki at his best br br the sound track is very reminiscent of spirited away or vice versa as castle in the sky was produced first and much like its director joe hisaishi the composer starts with a very light score that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward br br a note to the english dubbing with a good interpretation from the two lead stars although anna paquins sheeta has a very thick accent which the actress still had at that point in her career and a heads up for mark hamil as muska making up for a delighting yet devilish villain br br dont miss this one people
