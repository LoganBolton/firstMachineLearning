ive seen the original english version on video disneys choice of voice actors looks very promising i cant believe im saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film the animation quality is excellent if youve seen disneys job of kikis delivery service you can see the quality in their production it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion but not quite finally miyazakis films are being released properly i cant wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa
