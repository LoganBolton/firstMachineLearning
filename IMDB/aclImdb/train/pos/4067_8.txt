hayao miyazakis second feature film and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically though his debut  nausicaa aka warriors of the wind is considered by many fans his best tenku no shiro rapyuta aka castle in the sky may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like kikis delivery service mononokehime and spirited away but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime its important to remember that castle in the sky was made two years before the revolutionary akira and while its not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero  heroine  villain type characters and the story is quite predictable and obvious at least in todays standards miyazakis designs and animation work are of standards never seen before while the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable  if not as breathtaking as spirited away and if youll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the lowbudget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces  at this point miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of japanese cartooning  youll see miyazakis genius shine through as well as it does on spirited away and mononoke while castle in the sky being a scifi adventure and very suitable for children fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since his motifs and principles still show and play an important part to say much more would be to ruin the movie so ill kindly shut up suffice to say that im giving it only nine stars because if i gave it ten i couldnt go any higher for spirited away and princess mononoke and that would be a crimebr br as in most anime movies i recommend watching the japanese version with the english subtitles even if you dont speak a word of japanese  the english overdubs just dont tend to be very good and in this case its just horrendous you might want to watch it in the english version once though just for the laughs and for the starfilled cast the english dub was only recorded following the success of spirited away as it was for kikis delivery service  anna paquin and james van der beek yeah the dawson guy fill the lead roles mark hamill luke skywalker from star wars in case you dont know plays the villain and other roles are filled by andy dick tres macneille the simpsons rugrats animaniacs michael mcshane friar tuck from kevin costners robin hood travesty and mandy patinkin hello my name is inigo montoya good for a laugh or a few laughs really but watch the japanese one first
