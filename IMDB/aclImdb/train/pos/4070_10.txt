i know anime ive been into it long before it became a national phenomenon i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was and just so you know im not bragging about my let me say this out of all the animes ive seen castle in the sky is by far one of the best its obvious people say spirited away is the best but i really disagree most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award this isnt an exaggeration  ive shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people whod only ever seen spirited away and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three personally id never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke until i finally saw castle in the sky i still think that the prior is the better of the two but castle in the sky is easily on par with it in many ways castle has major elements that mononoke was missing in either case if youve only seen spirited away and think that that is miyazakis best film be prepared to have your earth shaken
