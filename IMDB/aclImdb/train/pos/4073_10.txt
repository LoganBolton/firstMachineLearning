have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own with one of your closest friends at your side facing all sorts of dangers and villains and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization thats just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets even if youre not quite that much of a fantasylover have you ever wished you could simply experience what its like to be a kid again and not have a care in the world for just a couple of hours br br this is exactly what miyazakis castle in the sky is all about pazu a young but very brave and ambitious engineer lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail simply put it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another and i cant help but feel my worries melt away every time i see itbr br as it is one of miyazakis older works and takes much place in the everyday world the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away howls moving castle or even princess mononoke still i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other because all three of those films are at some point or another mystical to the point of being enigmatic if not perplexing especially for the youngest of viewersbr br castle in the sky on the other hand doesnt try so much to be an allegory of any kind and its not a comingofage story either it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a childs mind ive ever seen not only is the artwork beautiful but the use of perspective from the kids eyes is just amazing whether its the panning up of the camera to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air i just cant help but feel like im there with pazu and sheeta just a kid in another world far far away from realitybr br even the kids themselves dont have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitakasan or chihirohaku sheeta is pazus angel having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start as the film progresses more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film only growing stronger all the way to the last frame for that reason ive fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couplebr br at the same time castle in the sky is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be youll be sure to find your fix here mystery action drama comedy suspense scifi romance even some westernits all here just about everything people go to the movies for except maybe horror this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film its perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent worksbr br even the ending song of the film when translated into english conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization and some kind of soulmate that could not be found in our mundane lives the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of themthe earth spins carrying you carrying us both wholl surely meet miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashis gorgeous scores but this is the only one ive seen thats both a touching love song and an inspirational dream i have found myself near tears just listening to itbr br castle in the sky may not be miyazakis most developed spectacular or meaningful work but its absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids sit back relax and love it for what it is
