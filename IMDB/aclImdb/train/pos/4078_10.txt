this is one of my all time favorite movies period i cant think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does this flick has it all action adventure science fiction good vs bad and even some romance without even an innocent peck on the cheek between the pazu and sheeta maybe best of all you dont have to be in mensa to get it and enjoy the movie like you do with some of miyazakis other movies i dont know about you but i watch movies to take a break from thinking this is just a flatout enjoyable movie that everyone will like so do yourself a favor and go buy it the only sour note is the american dubbing i found vandergeek to be just plain annoying but all is not lost the original japanese version is on the twodisc set and it rocks who cares if you cant understand spoken japanese if you can read at a secondgrade level then watch the original japanese recording with english subtitles you wont regret it
