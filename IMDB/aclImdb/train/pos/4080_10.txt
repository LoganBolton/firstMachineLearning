this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare  better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tensionfilled adventure ridebr br why is this film so good because its a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compellingbr br most japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trenchcoat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed  not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulbr br the voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if youve got itbr br one aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part onedimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60
