i have seen just about all of miyazakis films and they are all beautiful and captivating but this one rises above the rest this movie totally impressed mebr br i fell in love with pazu and sheeta and their sweet caring friendship they were what made the movie for me of course the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly but the characters are the shining point in this movie they are so well developed and full of personalitybr br now let me clarify im really talking about the japanese version of the movie with english subs while the english dub is good mostly it simply pales in comparison to the original language version the voices are better the dialogue everything so i suggest seeing and hearing the movie the way it originally was
