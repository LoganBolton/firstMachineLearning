wow uhmwellwow i guess ill start with the plot a betrothed woman lucy arrives at the family home of her would be husband mathurin in france where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the catholic church to marry them to satisfy a will while waiting young lucy learns about a legend of a beast who roamed the grounds centuries before in bed that night she begins fantasizing about the beast and his rapeturnedconsensual tryst with the former lady of the house thats where it gets interesting the plot is really pretty thin and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick but the filmmaker rewards  those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finalebr br this movie isnt for everyone if youre looking for great cinema look elsewhere if youre looking for a farout movie about bestiality that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject this movie is for you if you have a weak stomach dont be afraid of this one outside of some horseonhorse action at the beginning the deeds are pretty cartoonish imo
