i must say i thought i had seen it all i am an extremely jaded movie buff this movie didnt shock me by any means im way past that point but it did take me to certain emotional places i didnt know i could go to i had no idea i could ever find ick the idea of beastiality erotic never never never ever ever but there you go he did it i have to give the director credit he pulled it offbr br for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasnt a mistake then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married then some nervous guy shaves then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake in fact i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next nightbr br we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorianera gal being ravaged by a beastthing in the forest the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat hehheh of the whole deal its beautifully shot superbly edited and does deliver the goods they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesnt either oh well i would definitely recommend this film the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it
