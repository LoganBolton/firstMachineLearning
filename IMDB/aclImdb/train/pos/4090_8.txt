this movie is simply incredible i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw however it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a highbrow sort of pornography it even features a scene that comes extremely close to rapebr br meanwhile i strongly suggest seeing this rare work of sexual art every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies by the way one should not forget how times have changedbr br go see it it´s worth your money and time
