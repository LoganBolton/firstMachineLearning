for anyone who has only seen disney productions beautifully animated version of beauty  the beast or even jean cocteaus surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 french but with a director from poland version the plot concerns a french family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do english family the major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family the film also includes many flashback sequences potentially explaining this family curse from the opening credits to the very end its a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride with some very explicit  graphic sexual content hence the films x rating in the us in its initial runwhich is now unrated the films somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of bunuels flights into similar territory if you have a taste for the truly bizarre and are not offended by taboo material then this film may just scratch that itch for you
