youth sexuality and the french countryside  one of the more unique films youre ever going to see if you can see it that is no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it a combination of scarcity and censorship its sometimes erotic sometimes disgusting and occasionally funny a trifle boring also in the middle but all in all you cant call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until youve seen this one at least once
