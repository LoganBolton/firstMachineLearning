okthis ones a weirdyhonestly i cant tell you all the inner plotpoints of the beast cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes  but just wait it definitely does pick upbr br the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day eventually you see the beast which looks like a guy dressed in a giant ratbear costume with a horse cock attached to it the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared the beast pops up rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beasts attention which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere yeah ive got a twisted footfetish  so sue methe whole film is told in flashbacks and longwinded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious a shocking but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange filmbr br the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate the cinematography itself is quite eyecatching and the sets costumes and locations are elaborate the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a ratbear a good bit of tits ass and hairy 70s french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film i have to honestly say that if it werent for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden this film would have been a real bore  that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex the beginning has a very upclose and personal scene of two horses boning including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vaginayum but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks theyve seen it all  the beast rape really is outthere and something to be witnessed also recommended to any fans of 70s80s sleaze films  this one ranks pretty high with them worth a look for you sick ratbear beastiality lovers out there like me810
