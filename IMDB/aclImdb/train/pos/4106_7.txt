this definitely is not the intellectual film with profound mission so i really dont think there is too much not to understand to in case you arent czechbr br its just a comedy the humor is simple pretty funny and sometimes maybe little morbid some actors and characters are very similar to samotári 2000 jirí machácek ivan trojan vladimír dlouhý so the authors are but it doesnt matter the genre is really different and these two films shouldnt be compared in this way jedna ruka netleská wont try to give you a lesson it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeedbr br not bad film not the ingenious one but i enjoyed it some scenes are truly worth seeing
