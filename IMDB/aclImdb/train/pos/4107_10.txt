i loved this movie its truly bizarre extremely funny morbid witty it makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie because then id be giving out the outcome you have to see it without knowing what is it about everything is connected and has its why  because it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine its even more fun to watch the movie the second time once you know all the tricks the actors are excellent especially ivan trojan whose final scenes are a real master piece i highly recommend this film its one of the most original ones ive ever seen
