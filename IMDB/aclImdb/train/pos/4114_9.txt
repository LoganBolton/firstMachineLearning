the title of this movie doesnt make a lot of sense until you see it in operation because its the sound that a retarded young man makes while hes operating his imaginary trolley which is what he does all day and he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal  at times tragic tale of a group of slumdwellers in japanbr br there are two drunks who trade wives theres a man with aspirations to be a architect and his young son who he sends out to beg for food theres a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him and theres a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him and everyone else like dirtbr br theres no particular plot to this really its a bunch of stories that drift back  forth between each other sometimes funny sometimes tragic all in all i thought it worked pretty well  i had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description i was not in the least disappointed and id definitely recommend this 9 out of 10
