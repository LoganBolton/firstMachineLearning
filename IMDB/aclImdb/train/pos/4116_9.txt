most people when they think of expressionist cinema look to the bw german films of the silent and early sound erasfilms that emphasized canted angles extreme contrasts of light and dark exaggerated performance and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional naturalistic modes of cinematic representation if were willing to accept that the germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema and that those abovementioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film then i would argue that dodeskaden dkd is a prime example of this type of film br br like dreams dkd is a little unhinged for a kurosawa film dabbling as it does in the unreal however dkd is also unlike dreams a great film and probably my favorite kurosawa picture why mostly i think its the colors this was i believe kurosawas first color film and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors creating a completely unreal contemporary japan we are used to the neon lights and gleaming tokyo skyscrapers we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons br br dkd is as i said a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard appearing to live in an alternate universe that is i think the pointthese are the tokyo outsiders the people left behind during the great move forward following world war ii the film also represents one of kurosawas more heartfelt movies there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos such as when the boys father describes their dream home its an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning john fordlike vistas and samurais everyone should have known kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways br br i will also argue to the last that this is kurosawas greatest achievement his samurai films though capable pictures pale in comparison to works by kobayashi harakiri is the greatest most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid rashomon hidden fortress seven samurai yojimbo sanjuro kagemusha and ran are all fine films but theyre merely good and frankly i think that word is too generous for hidden fortress and kagemusha dkd is a great movie as is ikiru they are the crown jewels that show akira was not a onetrick samurai pony they reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema
