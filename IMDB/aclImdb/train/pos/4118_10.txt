if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodeskaden it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didnt stop delivering what hes infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldnt be ignored but its not at all a fault of kurosawasbr br the material in dodeskaden is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot theres things that happen to these people and kurosawas challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as theres not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged manchild who goes around all day making train sounds the clicketyclack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off theres the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with sitespecific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on hes lost a lot more than hell tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle im not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social aroundbr br there are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and theres the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course theres a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless its about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture its a little postapocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets its a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathlylooking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with itbr br sometimes theres charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawas cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as theyve always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them ie the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like its one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter its like the abstract has come fullthrottle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath its a brilliant tricky doubleedged sword that allows for the dreamlike intonations with such heavy duty dramabr br with a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodeskaden is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality
