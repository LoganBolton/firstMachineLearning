another demonstration of kurosawas genius his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring postwar shanty town swinging from comedy to tragedy and back this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol mixing kitchensink realism with kabukiesque theatrics kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness a wonderful draining experience
