this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is 5910576 votes as of this writing this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mindblowing battles  they have to be seen to be believed the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got some lines were not translated  br br i just dont understand when i read  hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i couldnt follow the story or characters came from nowhere from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it ive watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment oh and this is not just my opinion because ive shown this movie to many fellow americans people who have never seen an hk film before who feel the same way not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie oh man why cant we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storylinebr br this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you wont want to leave ive seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by tsui hark and the 2001 is far better in comparison imobr br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i didnt want it to end im begging you mr hark  can we please have a sequel
