its a cooking competition show americanized its not going to be the japanese versionbr br the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv br br you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh its entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize br br oh yeah and im bitter john besh isnt the new iron chef br br ala cuisine
