a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort the divorce of lady x 1938  it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors and while olivier and oberon are not particularly wellsuited to screwball comedy it all flows along nicely oberon is leslie a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logans olivier hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel she does everything possible to irritate himbut in the crazy way films go he falls for her and she falls for him but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberons lady x thats all she leaves oliver in a note is thought by olivier to be a married woman to make matters worse and more amusing lord mere ralph richardson goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon there is some nice battleofthesexes dialogue and fun exploration of sexual politics you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy but in true olivier hes a consummate professional and delivers and he handles the screwball twists and turns maybe not with ease but with gusto oberon was no great shakes as an actress but she was usually competent enough and despite their reputed offscreen dislike of her worked well with olivier this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson but perhaps the print needs cleaning up
