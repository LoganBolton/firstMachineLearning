i really wonder how this show plays in the uk and the rest of europe it is so selfloathing about being an americanparticularly white americans that could be a big reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this board i love the show but it is with some reservations and i feel it took the easy way out by spoiler spoilerbr br crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season julie slammed the door shut on any hope of reviving the show unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farm who knows it was a funny raunchy and on occasion kinda scary show
