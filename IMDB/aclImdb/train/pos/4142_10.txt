fatty drives the bus is simply the funniest most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeingbr br this movie is by no means up to hollywood standards or even that of a straighttovideo movie fluff comedy starring terry hulk hogan in terms of camera work editing acting budget or anything elsebr br what this movie does have though is a very original and enjoyable story and it is obviously done by people who love making it and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting downfallsbr br this movie proves that you dont need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great film all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doingbr br simply the best movie ever i dont care how you get it rent it order it steal it download it just see this moviebr br now i just hope they make a dvd version
