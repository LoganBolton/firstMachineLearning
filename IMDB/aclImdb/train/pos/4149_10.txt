reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown  but when i watched it i could not stop laughing it has officially become my new favourite moviebr br i dont know what all the hate here is about maybe its because a movie of this kind has never really been around before i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead but there will be a lot of supporting male characters this one was almost all women  with the exception of seth meyers justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett  and it worked all of the actresses delivered very funny performances especially missi pyle from a quirky and lovable scriptbr br the charm of this film to me seems to be in its subtle feminist message accepting who you are female success in the public sphere the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles lighthearted though it is each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more fun conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to bebr br missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its allfemale cast and lack of a bigname actor to get the studios behind it and i have to agree everyone ive recommended this film to has loved it and i think its a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasnt been widely accepted and successfulbr br i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of femalecentred comedy
