i have watched quite a few cold case episodes over the years beginning with season 1 episodes back in 20032004 and while most have been good this particular episode was not only the best of the best but has few rivals in the emmy categories though some may not agree with the story content ie the maletomale romantic relationship i doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spiritbr br the story is essentially about a case that was reopened based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer the two central actors are two police officers in the 1960s named sean coop aka the cold case victim who goes by his last name coop and his partner jimmy bruno br br in the story coop is single a vietnam war vet with a deeply troubled past jimmy however is married with children no less both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that timebr br the flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout examples include their red squad car the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in jimmys bedroom where jimmys wife watched coop and jimmy drink fight and then kiss each other while being in an alcoholinduced state i found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes with everything else in black and white i still have not figured out the color scheme and rationalebr br the clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode one key emotional scene was when coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of jimmys baby in this scene coops father sarge who was a respected fellow officer on the force confronts coop about the rumors surrounding coops relationship with jimmy one can feel sorry for coop at this point as the shame and disgrace of coops father was heaped upon coop  you are not going to disgrace our familyand youre not my son either  clearly indicative of the hostile views of samesex relationships of that erabr br additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where coop and another officer go at it after coop and jimmy are labeled batman and robin homos br br as for the relationship between coop and jimmy its obvious that coop wanted more of jimmy in his life once can see the tension in jimmys face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids his church and yet his undying devotion to coopbr br in the end jimmy walks away from coop realizing that he cannot have both coop and his family at the same time sadly coop is killed perhaps because of his relationship with jimmy but coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the forcebr br the most moving scene in the whole episode was when coop as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner jimmywe were the lucky ones dont forget thatbr br the soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode i enjoyed the final scene with the actor chad everett playing the still grieving jimmy only much older by now and clearly still missing his former partner coopbr br i highly recommend this episode and consider it the best it is without a doubt the most wellwritten wellacted and well done of all cold case episodes that ive ever seen
