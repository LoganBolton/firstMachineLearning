anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuros quest to avenge his mothers death but also grows up in the process the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuros journey from boyhood to manhood the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated you can tell its a 70s movie and the animation is only slightly better than your average star blazers episode but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesnt matter a mustsee for any animation fan
