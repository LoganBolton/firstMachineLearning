galaxy express 999 ginga tetsudô threenine made in 1979 directed by rintaro based on the original work by leiji matsumotobr br what little i know of the history of galaxy express 999 it was first published as a popular manga in 1970s and was created by leiji matsumoto ge999 is set in the same star warstype of space universe as matsumotos other famous space manga captain harlock in fact space pirate harlock and other characters from that manga including queen emeraldas and tochirô oyama make appearances in ge999 ge999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes it was aired in 1978 a year later came this anime film which isnt a sequel to the series but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie br br the story is set in unidentified star warstype of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility people of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years maybe even forever the protagonist tetsurô hoshino is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel count mecha whose entire body is made of mechanical parts kills tetsurôs mother tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body to obtain it he must travel to a faraway planet with space train galaxy express 999 however since tetsurô comes from poverty he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket by a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman maetel who bears a resemblance to his dead mother maetel offers a ticket for tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey and so the journey beginsbr br i first saw this film last october about six months from now and again yesterday i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film it seems very rushed then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series whatever the case the situations change with a fast speed and tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes br br however theres no arguing that ge999 has deserved its place as an anime classic the animation itself very faithful to the style of matsumotos manga is detailed and beautiful to watch even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become out of date but puts many later anime films in shame the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat old these day it was the 70s after all i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good voice actors give life to their characters most memorable ones being masako nozawa mainly known as the voice of goku through out the entire dragon ball saga as the excited and young tetsurô and masako ikeda as the calm and mysterious maetel the supporting characters are not left in shadows but also have a life of their own most memorable to me being waitress claire br br the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours as well as for those who try to find deeper messages ge999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as tetsurôs journey from boyhood to manhood the whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels i think many people can relate to tetsurô for despite the fantasy elements he is a very realistic character young hot headed awkward and naive we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end when she reveals who and what she really is it doesnt much answer to anything maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man always close but just out of reach br br its is the strange yet beautiful relationship between tetsurô and maetel that still awakes talking and questions and fascinates after the decades people have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends of mother and son or of two possible lovers which wakes a lot of critique since maetels age is unknown and tetsurô hasnt even reached his puberty yet without any means to sound deep i think the best term to describe them is soul mates there is no question that the two feel devotion caring and love for each others yet it goes beyond that of friendship family and lovers i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters the ending scene even if you already know what is going to happen is still very touching and memorablebr br all in all despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes galaxy express 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like katsuhiro otomos akira 1988 and mamoru oshiis ghost in the shell 1995 the film is directed by rintaro who had previous experience of leiji matsumotos works as he had worked in captain harlock series later rinatro directed a wonderful looking metropolis 2001 that also questions the difference between humans and machines br br galaxy express 999 1979 is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan
