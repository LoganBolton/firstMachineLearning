yeah it is in fact its somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies number 15 i think anyways im usually not one for plots but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games final fantasy 7 for example and not movies but this one has it all vivid drawings of planets stars an extremely well written screenplay while this is not really for children they can still watch it it contains no graphic blood guts and silicone but i dont think theyre going to understand it
