i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time if youve never understood the appeal of anime discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otakutownbr br the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scotts blade runner the cell animation while somewhat traditional possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumotos great talent for character design and visual storytellingbr br this is one of those unique childrens films like star wars the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends family entertainment status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own termsbr br i highly recommend this film
