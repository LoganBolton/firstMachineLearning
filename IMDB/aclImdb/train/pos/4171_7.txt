i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film oops didnt notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior and was very pleased to be able to watch it again and in its entiretybr br i dont wholly understand the phenomenon but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons but are they actually scary no not very likewise in the years since the 70s weve gotten horror movies that are cooler more exciting have much better production values and sophisticated special effects are more fun funnier have effective jump moments and some very creative uses of gore but again they arent really scary theres just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films the grainy film quality the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast hightech lighting rigs the edge of dreamland muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eqd scores the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s in the case of horror works in its favorbr br specifically in this film the quiet intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling slavering and overtly hostile cujo the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its fullon supernatural form the effects when that occurs while unsophisticated by todays standards literally gave me chills the bizarre vaguelydefined im not quite sure what im looking at look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be rather than the hyperreal crystal clear optical printer  digital compositor confections of latterday horror filmsbr br while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit the actors all do a decent job the pairing of the brother and sister from the witch mountain movies as yes brother and sister is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting but they do fine yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses his selfdoubt as he wonders whether his familys alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether hes merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what hes been experiencing is absurd in its naïvetébr br the movies theendquestionmark type ending is one of the only ones ive seen that doesnt feel like a cheap gimmick and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what theyd be likely to do and how theyd feel about itbr br detractors of this film may say its merely a featurelength vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots but hey you could say the same thing about blade runner
