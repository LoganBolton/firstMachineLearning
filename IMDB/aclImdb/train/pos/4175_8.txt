i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old slovenian movies seemed to have in them well in time i wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia or did that feeling decide to pack its bags and say goodbye somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history and then never came back or did it because for me it came back the first time i saw ekspres ekspres and it was its old self againbr br there are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch  the smooth flow of the story the warmth of the colors and what i appreciated the most  the lack of excessive use of verbal communication something many of other not just slovenian screenwriters should at least consider there is no use for words when you can understand each other just as well yeah or better by other means in use just watch bakovic and cerar uhbr br so this in only so many words is why i would recommend ekspres ekspres to all of you as a mustsee slovenian movie regardless of what you may heard of slovenian films if you ever even heard anything  that isbr br oh and that scene where bakovic is dancing to vivaldis music a treatbr br treat yourself watch it
