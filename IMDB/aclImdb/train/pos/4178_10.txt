this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years not pompous like the british not gungho like the americans if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did it would have failed dismally either due to ignorance on the british part or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side true australians ie nonimports are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives just look at examples like gallipoli paschendale tobruk new guinea and vietnam
