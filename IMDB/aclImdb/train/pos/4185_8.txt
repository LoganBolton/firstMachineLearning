this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching  sloppy editing little to no continuity insane dialog bad you might even say nonexistent acting pointless story lines shots that go on far too longand its perfect for mst3kstyle riffing not to mention the corpse eaters drinking game scribble on formstake a shot  sign your nametake a shot  catch a bad foley edittake many many shotsbr br the only reason i didnt rate it higher than 8 is because theres not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness its only an hour long  hell a movie like this should have been at least 2030 minutes longer
