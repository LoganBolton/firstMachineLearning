this is a pretty decent example of film noir the setting is the early 50s with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us governmentbr br richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing alist about him the interesting thing was that he was not only an antihero but through most of the film an unlikeable antihero that is not very normal jean peters gave a soso performance as the hooker with the heart of gold that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stoolpigeonbr br the plot had its fair share of twists and turns wisecracks and tough talk there is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and excitingbr br i think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film for nonnoir viewers it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone
