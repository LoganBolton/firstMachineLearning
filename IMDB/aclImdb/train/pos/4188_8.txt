samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films while shock corridor and the naked kiss represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and the big red one was an effective portrait of the horrors of war merrills marauders painted war as necessary hell and pickup on south street is about the dangers of communist spies all of his films make for very entertaining viewing and even though he was often pigeonholed as a bfilmmaker fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors pickup on south street is no exception and despite the dated themes the filmmaking style is remarkably ahead of its time its also a very quicklypace tight and occasionally brutal film noirbr br the acting across the board is fantastic richard widmark makes for a great antihero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend the show stealer is thlema ritter however in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie the angles fuller employs are great making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later pickup on south street is a great actionpaced noir thriller shock corridor remains my favorite fuller film but this is a very close second 810
