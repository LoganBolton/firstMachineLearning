thelma ritter did steal the picture i just finished watching it again i couldnt help becoming emotional in her final scene she didnt get the oscar thats why you shouldnt put too much faith in oscars richard widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3d flawed human being jean peters was great as the streetwise tough girl in her best role ever and richard kiley must have been very good why else would i have hated him so yes it was heavy handed on the patriotism but without it you dont have much of a film watch their faces the top three stars didnt really need much script i would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue if youve ever seen ray milland and rita gam in the thief maybe you know what i mean when i was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to nyc i made my bronx uncle drive us to the foot of south street looking for no 66 thats when i knew that hollywood couldnt be trusted but i did find the riverbr br im not giving away much of the story because i hate it when i know what happens before i see it for myself if you have seen it no elucidation is necessary just maybe someone who is reading these comments hasnt seen pickup on south street you will like it just dont go looking for 66 south street in new york city
