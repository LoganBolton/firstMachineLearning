director sam fuller has something of a cult following particularly in europe yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable he did however direct one really terrific movie in pickup on south street made pretty early on in his career the movies that followed were vastly inferiorbr br from the first to the last frame pickup works on all levels its filmed with flawless fluidity boasting fine performances all round richard widmark and thelma ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances are at their peak widmark who was no stranger at playing villains while truly mean to the core still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making jean peters characters falling for him all the more crediblebr br fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie there is a scene in which jean peters get roughed up by widmark its truly shocking in its reality this is not a case of carefully choreographed photographybr br less self conscious than many film noirs of the period this remains a great example of the genre
