this film is a spicy little piece of filmmaking from sam fuller which gives richard widmark the chance to show of some of his best most edgy acting in the role of skip mccoy a smalltime thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful candys jean peters pocket on a crowded bus it turns out candy was doing a favor for her exboyfriend whos working for the commiesbr br superficially theres a mystery here regarding candys motives and skip spends much of the film determining her motives actually he seems to just initially assume that shes a commie going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture but the real question is  whats going on with skip what are his motives and why does candy like him so much why do we the audience want to like him so much basically what the filmmakers have done here is create a very striking male fatale in widmarks character and his performance just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like the big sleep or the glass key along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face the filmmakers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers widmark is handsome and theres also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady he robs her and then punches her in the face eventually the question becomes  would skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck his comments to the police like youre waving a flag at me make us suspect he would or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend moe thelma ritter im not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either waybr br thelma ritters character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here fuller isnt afraid to give her plenty of business  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world particularly her used ties another example of fullers business would be the scene with victor perry an actor ive seen elsewhere used to less effect using the chopsticks to intimidate candybr br the emphasis on moes relationship with skip provides one of cinemas most revealing honor among thieves themes in fact skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police with the notable exception of capt tiger murvyn vye who has a grudge against him i loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is realistic or whether that would matter are entirely separate questionsbr br all told i would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the film noir school of filmmaking a predictable plot is offset by a host of colorful characters uniformly wellperformed cheap sets are disguised by the films unrelenting pace and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is this is the best film ive seen so far by sam fuller and helps me to see better why hes regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that i think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like the crimson kimono and shock corridor as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense this is one of my favorite performances from widmark that ive seen so far  and widmark was a talent that im tempted to say based on the few extraordinary films ive seen with him was comparable to that of alan ladd or humphrey bogart although arguably he didnt make as many classic films
