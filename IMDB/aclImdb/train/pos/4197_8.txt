shock corridor 1963 was my first film from samuel fuller and there i was impressed with the directors astute blending of bmovie and bigbudget aesthetics even if the story itself was pure schlock pickup on south street 1953 was released a decade earlier in fullers career obviously produced on a larger budget from a bigname studio twentieth centuryfox nevertheless the visuals are still notable in that theres a somewhat raw naturalistic element to the photography not unlike dassins the night and the city 1950 and kazans panic in the streets 1950 the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald in some scenes fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors faces that theyre out of focus bluntly registering the intimate thoughts emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features the eye though unexpectedly prone to melodrama and with just a hint of anticommunist propaganda pickup on south street is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of new york citybr br when justoutofprison pickpocket skip mccoy richard widmark snags the purse of a woman on the subway jean peters he pockets more than hed originally bargained for the woman candy and her cowardly exboyfriend joey richard kiley had been smuggling topsecret information to the communists and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of microfilm will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities or sell it to the highest bidder if pickup on south street has a flaw its that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anticommunist agenda reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii dwight taylor who supplied the story also notably wrote the thin man goes home 1944 the only propagandistic movie of the series for no apparent reason every identifiable character  even the smugly selfserving skip mccoy  eventually becomes a selfsacrificing patriot the transformation predictable from the outset in traditional film noir the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance the rational punishment for his sins but apparently not when theyve served their country patriotism wipes the slate cleanbr br richard widmark an actor who im really beginning to like plays the haughty pickpocket with composure though always with that hint of illease that suggests hes biting off more than he can chew the opening scene on the train is the films finest as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victims hand bag recalling bressons pickpocket 1959 thelma ritter is terrific as a tired streetwoman wholl peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it though of course she draws the line at commies jean peters is wellcast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bowlegged strut of a prostitute nevertheless peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the films attempts at realism fascinatingly upon its release pickup on south street was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite go figure
