from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work richard widmark stealing from a womans purse jean peters pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch partly its because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast the bw photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters and because samuel fullers direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john asphalt jungle huston in fact it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrongbut the payoff is not quite as strongbr br jean peters is excellent as the hardedged girl whom widmark describes as being knocked around a lot she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a microfilm in her purse for her boyfriend richard kiley something the fbi already knows about theyre on her trail when the theft occursbr br thelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called moe who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life shes particularly touching in her final scene with kileybr br this one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark peters and ritter
