this is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by sam fuller in the early 1950s this minimalist and fastworking director has something unusual for his earlier filmsa cast with some stars richard widmark jean peters and richard kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of americaand theyll stop at nothing to succeedbr br the film starts with peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents they know she is a link in a long espionage chain unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equationa smalltime pickpocket widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that peters is carrying widmark thinks its just another purse hes ransackedonly later does he realize the seriousness of what hes stolen now its widmark on his ownwith commies and the fbi hot on his trailbr br widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish although she didnt get top billing a special mention should be made of thelma ritter this supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and i was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old ladybr br as far as the script and directing go they are very goodbut with one small exception at first i loved the way widmark and peters interacted its one of the few times on film youll see a woman punched square in the mouth now thats tough later inexplicably they become amazingly closetoo close to be believable still with so much great drama and such an effective noirlike film this can be overlooked see this film
