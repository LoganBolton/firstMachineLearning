and anyone who watches this film will agree this film was directed in the days when plot character believability and theme actually matteredbr br jean peters widmark and thelma ritter steal the spotlight ritter is in top form as informer moe she survives in the bowery section of ny acting as a stool pigeon for nyc policebr br the only other film in which i have seen peters is niagara and she certainly proves her acting ability here complete with brooklyn accent widmark is appropriately menacing as the antihero who must discern what the right thing is despite his need for cashbr br the photography is brilliant the neon the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing the harbor shack where widmark lives as a transient excellent use is made of the city with lightning louie in chinatown the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop 1010
