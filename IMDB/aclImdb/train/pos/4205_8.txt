samuel fuller is hardly one of americas great directors im not sure he qualifies as one of hollywoods great craftsmen but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywoods true professionals who were willing to march to their own music during the time he worked for hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its partson time and on budget pickup on south street is a case in point on the surface its one more of hollywoods early fifties anticommie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hardboiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy fuller turns this bag of hollywood clich√©s into a taut exciting drama with any number of offkilter twists the hero skip mccoy is a threetime loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesnt change his stripes until the very end the girl in the caper candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if youre so inclined one of the most appealing characters moe williams is a stoolie and in an unusual approach to hollywoods battle against commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears the hero isnt motivated by anything so ennobling he just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becomingat least for nowa good guy br br plus all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio he had to make do richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but jean peters is a surprise she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friendsor her clientswant her to be and richard kiley who later would become a two time tony award winning star on broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly its hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us i mean introduced to us the impossible dream from man of la mancha br br more than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the feds and the commies moves straight ahead with great economy the whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell the dialogue with fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hardboiled pulp fiction style that muffin you griftedshes okay one character says to skip about candy fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next then fuller throws in the character of moe williams all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability br br the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fullers talents and strengths in 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters  skip and candy  were going to be involved with and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us br br says glenn erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics in what should be an inconsequential story sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up stiffnecked aggressive selfinterest that when fully expressed recognizes whats wrong and whats right and isnt afraid to fight for it as always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort hes right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years
