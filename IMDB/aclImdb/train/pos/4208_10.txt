every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one this also happened in the 50s with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the 50s that are worth digging out panic in the streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind both are movies that arent really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resourcesbr br i was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed like all old movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and its characters youre in for a real treat with this moviebr br the movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesnt start of like that it begins as this typical crimethriller with a touch of filmnoir to it but pickup on south street just isnt really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watchbr br i also really liked the characters within this movie none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses really humane it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seenbr br even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by morebr br 1010
