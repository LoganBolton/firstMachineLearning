the best of the seven sam fuller movies that ive seen including park row run of the arrow verboten shock corridor the naked kiss the big red one and this film pickup on south street counts as one of the best film noirs it represents fuller at his most controlled i like him when hes out of control of course but nearly everything in pickup is perfect the film is absolutely beautiful richard widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend played by richard kiley peters is forced to find widmark and get it back she finds him through a stool pigeon played by thelma ritter widmark and peters are attracted to each other which changes peters loyalties that and the fact that she learns shes working for communists the cold war stuff is really interesting the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable but its not so bad that it harms the film unlike fullers previous film park row richard widmark is great this must be one of his best roles but im not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema i will never forget that 1010
