in this excellent twentiethcentury fox filmnoir the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolismbr br a prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway it contains a microfilm and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious informationbr br antihero pickpocket skip mccoy is played with scornful assurance by richard widmark he knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors so he taunts them go on he says to captain dan tiger murvyn vye drum up a charge throw me in youve done it before in this pitiless world the cops are just one more gang on the streets just as candy the hooker bribes lightning louie to get a lead so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for informationbr br it is hard to believe that when widmark made this film he was already in early middle age the 39yearold star coming to the end of his contract with fox plays the upstart skip mccoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face but by the mores of the period it signified toughness  and candy after all is a fallen womanbr br jean peters is radiant as candy here right in the middle of her fiveyear burst of bmovie fame she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart she is the storys victim a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else she means well but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men  joey skip and the copsbr br the real star of this movie is new york haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living malevolent force like maggots in a rotting cheese human figures scurry through the citys byways elevators subway turnstiles sidewalks  even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity people cling to any niche that affords safety moe has her grimy rented room skip his tenebrous shack on the hudson river as the characters move and interact they are framed by bridge architecture or lattices of girders or are divided by hanging winch tackle the personality of the city is constantly imposing itself the angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan and the cardindex cabinets in the squadroom mimic the manhattan skyline when joeys exit from the subway is barred it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring himbr br a surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme closeup character drives the plot as it should and the closeups are used to augment character when skip interrogates candy the closeup captures the sexual energy between them belying the hostility of skips words jean peters beauty is painted in light in exquisite soft focus closeups the device is also employed to heighten the tension the opening sequence the purse snatch contains no dialogue the drama relies entirely on closeup for its powerful effectbr br snoopers and snoopers upon snoopers populate the film moe thelma ritter makes a living as an informant and her place in the hierarchy is accepted even by her victims when skip observes shes gotta eat he is chanting a recurring refrain just as straight new yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber the underworld traffics in the commodity of informationbr br and yet even the stool pigeons are superior to joey and his communist friends joeys feet on moes bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code joey is beyond the pale moe will not trade with joey even to preserve her life   even in our crummy business you gotta draw the line somewherebr br pickup was made in the depths of the cold war richard nixon had just been chosen as the republican vicepresidential candidate having made his name with his phoney alger hiss expose  bogus communist microfilm and all the mccarthy show trials were a daily reality we see the cops in the movie inveigh against the traitors who gave stalin the abombbr br new york can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats squeals and murders containers form a leitmotif throughout the film moe carries her trade mark box of ties and candys purse container of the microfilm is the engine of the plot skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate symbolising his secretive streetwisdom the paupers coffins moving down the hudson on a barge are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolisbr br the film is a masterpiece of composition candy is shown above the skulking skip on the rickety gangway of the shack signifying her moral ascendancy when the gun is placed on the table the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy  violence is beginning to dwarf compassion the lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedores hook reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage  a predatory phantom of the night camera shots from under taxi hoods inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis we are civilisations mulch
