it is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure to see the smug grin wiped off the face of abigail mitchell when she realises her victim has left deathbed testimony which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfyingbr br please understand while i admire ruth gordons performance her character really really irritates me she is selfish and demanding she gets her own way by putting on a simpering little girl act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age worse she has now set herself up as judge jury and executioner against her dead nieces husbandbr br when columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an offthecuff speech to an audience of highclass ladies he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police workbr br nothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice abbys final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much selfrespect not to do his job well here is one situation you cant squirm out of ms mitchell
