i havent really seen too many of the columbo films actually i think ive only watched one or two apart from this one ive always liked columbo though somehow without even having seen that much of him peter falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character because of his looks his voice and his charm the perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968 the latestand probably not last of the films was made in 2003 thats 35 years and falk was 40 back when he made the first one the series consists of 68 filmsunless my count is off all of which are made for tv everyone knows the character even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema that is quite an accomplishment if you ask me the plot is pretty good the only problem i have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginningthough that may be the same for all of the columbo films leaving no mystery but how columbo solves it making it somewhat dullsince theres not much to look forward to at the end of the film the pacing is good theres hardly a scene where youre bored the acting is very good particularly that of falk and ruth gordon they have some great exchanges of dialog in the film the characters are wellwritten and credible the dialog and script is unusually good for a tvmovie all in all the film is yes surprisingly good for a tvmovie and definitely worth watching for any fan of columbo andor crimemystery flicks 810
