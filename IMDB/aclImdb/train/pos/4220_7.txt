this is the one in which the diminutive ruth gordon plays an agathachristie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york he manages however to leave behind some clues scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and wellhidden note columbo enters the case suspects her at once and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers oh and mariette hartley is on hand as gordons secretary and wouldbe blackmailer hartley is i believe the grand daughter of the psychologist b f skinner im not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button which is on display during a belly dance sequence but ive always admired skinner anywaybr br the murder is well handled its a good plot and none of the performers or crew fluff anything but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon only a skosh over five feet tall she was over 80 years old and looked it there are moments when she almost teeters but she consistently exudes charm her acting is idiosyncratic you can never be sure when shes being serious or when shes putting columbo and the audience on shes given some good lines too what humor there is comes from gordon columbo doesnt have any of his frequent comic momentsbr br all in all a nice job by everyone concerned
