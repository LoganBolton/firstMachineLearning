i like this episode quite a bit ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was as has been stated the music is very good and it has a moodiness that doesnt exist in all episodesbr br but one major plot hole exists so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it it is established that the light doesnt work in the vault dont you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked youd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note granted this is tv whodunit fiction and various holes will always be found but this seems much too glaringbr br it really doesnt make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesnt work but the death bed testimony goes on unfound apparently for days
