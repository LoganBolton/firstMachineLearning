a top notch columbo from beginning to end i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ruth gordonbr br as an avid columbo fan i cant recall another one in which he doesnt set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes in this one as hes trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the message that the nephew left behind it finally dawns on himbr br the music in this episode is very good as well as it is in many of other ones
