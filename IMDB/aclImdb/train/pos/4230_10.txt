for columbo fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why columbo was so popular and just how good it really was ruth gordon has a field day as ever playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist abigail mitchell seems abigail calls her nephewinlaw to sign some papers making him her heir she never got over her nieces death and is convinced her dead nieces husband charles frank did the dirty deed to tell more would be unthinkable mariette hartley has a sly role as abigails personal assistant this episode of columbo is in a class by itself its a truly well made television movie i recommend it most highly
