attention spoilerbr br many people told me that «planet of the apes» was tim burtons worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film so i decided not to see it another friend of mine who hadnt seen the movie yet advised me to watch it in spite of this because a timburtonmovie is still a timburtonmovie i decided to do it and i found that he was rightbr br its clear that a remake of such a famous film as planet of the apes is automatically influenced by commercial thinking still tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as beetlejuice or batman if you are already fond of burtonmovies its hard not to like one of his films even if it has some flaws nerveracking monkey squeals overdressed apes and a leading actor who could have been without difficulties replaced by anbody elsebr br what the film gives us in the first place is an answer to the question whats the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake first of all burton wouldnt be burton if he wouldnt refuse to call it a remake from the start its a reimagining on the other hand burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston as human and he knows that a remake doesnt exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film e g by referencing to quotes concerning the storyline burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  and here is the spoiler  leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever br br now this is the burtonesque answer to peoples expectations they hold because of the astonishing shocking ending of the first planet of the apes an ending even more unexpected more astonishing and completely confusing because  and here im disagreeing with various planet of the apeshomepages and platforms  it does not make any sense there cannot be a meaning to it or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective tim burton is playing his cruel games he does it with a grin and he does it well burton fans will sure like it others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism well and i dont think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake again
