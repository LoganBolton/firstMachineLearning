after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me whatever happened to the old burton who read the dark knight returns by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 198889 by the looks of it burton didnt research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong this movie sucks its not as good as the original and it doesnt deal with the same subject as the original if you want a good ape movie watch the originalbr br out ofstars
