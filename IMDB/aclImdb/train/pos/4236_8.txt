take this movie for what it is not a remake but a completely different approach to the same concept its not an epic like the original its more of a popcorn thriller visually its incredible everything else was just ok br br for what it is i think the movie is awesome but i like everything burton has done people need to calm down and stop acting like its the end of the world bc of this movie it wasnt supposed to be a remake and its not br br the ending was cool  i took it as a parallel universe
