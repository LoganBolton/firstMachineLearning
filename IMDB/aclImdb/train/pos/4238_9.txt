on the surface this is an aboveaverage postwar romantic comedy beneath the veneer it is mgm character actor stuntcasting at its funniestbr br the leads are straightforward but all the secondaries are cast much against type margaret hamilton aka wicked witch of the west edward everett horton professional obsessivecompulsive fussbudget and sig ruman the marx brothers nemesis in night in casablanca and the alwayswonderful night at the opera playing a wellintentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together instead of driving them apart as their usual characters would dobr br it also pokes fun at many romanticcomedy conventions which is another indication that this could be not so much a straight romantic comedy as it is a wry sendup of the many postwar romantic comedies  their 2dimensional stock charactersbr br ive seen it only once with interruptions so i cant be positive but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made but is less successful now that viewers see these secondary characters through a completely different lens im assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars i thought it was hysterical
