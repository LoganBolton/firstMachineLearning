this film has slipped through the cracks of film history it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as the french connection or the taking of pelham 123 there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line its engaging from start to finish and hasnt tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examplesbr br ron liebman turns in a bravura performance as batman and its a shame his career didnt take off as a result of this projectbr br gordon parks directs and coming as it does after shaft it at first appears to be a strange choice yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismobr br unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states united artists really has a gem on their hands and its a shame theyre not doing anything with it
