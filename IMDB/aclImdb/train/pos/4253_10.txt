really excellent movie one of the best ive seen touching and simple  just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and its just beautiful not too much of anything just as its suppose to be really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of societys pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you dont have reasons to get angry  you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although its hard there lies the true happinessbr br great actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the moviebr br nice nice nicebr br i recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians life
