first saw this half a lifetime ago on a blackandwhite tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i dont find it hilarious i dont find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and lighthearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed itbr br its 1945 and fred macmurray is a 4f whos dying to get into one of the armed forces he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard hes managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army poof and he is marching along with washingtons soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy  redcoating germanspeaking hessians not brits the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland where the white wine is winier and the rhine waters rhinier and the bratwurst is mellower and the yellow hair is yellower and the frauleins are jucier and the goose steps are goosier something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as sig rumanns best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general you know heidelberg vee are 241 to 1 against you  but vee are not afraid br br i cant go on too long with these fantasies but theyre all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera dont you know that sailing west meant a terrifically expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but isabella queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i dont care what it looks like mutters columbus but that place is going to be called columbuslandbr br anyway everything is finally straightened out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girlbr br ive made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the hessians unless they happen to be college graduates in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say wow awesome
