ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it but truth is that the humour in this comedy is specialit is caratherisic for serbia and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well so i think the rest of audience for example in europecant enjoy it so much because the subtitles ruin the hole thing but they should at least try yes it is ironic this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesnt understand it  if you have got a chance to see this one dont blew up ok
