i like this movie a lot but its a fact that you cannot understand it unless youre from the ex yugoslavia most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection macedonia serbia montenegro bosnia and herzegowina croatia sloveniabr br all of this was ex yugoslavia a melting pot of the balcan nations it could be a dream land if slobodan milosevic franjo tudjman and other nationalists wouldnt poison the nations mind with their sick ideas
