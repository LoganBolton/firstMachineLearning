actually im surprised there were so many comments about this movie i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university but nobody in usa has heard of it which is a real shame the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad they are stuck together on a long bus tripsomeplace most of us have been but i never had one like this br br my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral then the man  woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the waythe consumptive starts hacking  they realize everybody is watching talk about surprised butyou really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did serb humor at its best
