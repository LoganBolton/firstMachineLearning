at first sight whos singing over there just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy with only a kind of unusual quiet and slow motion  what a mistake  br br beginning with two singers on a desert landscape then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors it hides a gem br br the folded story and a false rhythm induces you to think yes it is comic but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie br br not at all  very funny by instant dark subtle cynical on others its development surprises you all along the story very ingeniously and cleverly presented all the characters are important and the actors give them full lifebr br and what is astonishing its based on deep observation great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings and really everything the general direction and how also the details are presented that it simply makes you forget its a movie it is like to watch a kind human society you yet dont knowshot by a friend behind a camerabr br and youre the one behind him it is simple and simply exceptional br br dont misunderstand me in no way that would means the script  the quality of picture the music score have a kind of amateurish way no no  its great art  br br because it flows like a river from high up in the mountain down to the sea with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea from a tiny thing to a main streambr br this metaphoric image i used is the very best way i can find to explain all the charm that has whos singing over there for me again i take the hammer  simply exceptionalbr br ive seen that the director is the one who made chat blancchat noir which i know is quiet famous but as i yet didnt see it i had no idea about this gentlemanbr br others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film i fully agree br br european eastern cinema is not well know because seldom translated but i am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language with good english subtitles all in all  deep delicious and exceptionalbr br for fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs avoid it at any cost it may be too subtle and good for you br br but if youre interested in different genres andor classics i guess you wont regret this one and in case of buying it will have good companionship in your personal dvd library with such no less than merited big names like billy wilder lubitsch or sacha guitry among some of my preferred directors  at least for this movie br br a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet orson welles
