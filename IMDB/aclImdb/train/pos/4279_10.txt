years ago i was lucky enough to have seen this gem at a gypsy film festival in santa monica you know the ending is not going to be rosie and tragedy will strike but its really about the journey and characters and their dynamics and how they all fit into what was yugoslavia while i am not yugonostalgic and tend to shy away from the current crop of yugoslavian films give me ademir kenovic over late 90s kustarica id be happy to have the chance to stumble on this film again as it shines in my celluloid memories ever since seeing whos singing over there 15 years ago i still hear the theme tune sung by the gypsies ruminating through my head i am miserable i was born that way with the accompanying jews harp and accordian making the tune both funny and sad the late great actor pavle vujisic muzamer from when father was away on business was memorable as the bus driver of the illfated trip in his typical gruff yet loveable manner hi
