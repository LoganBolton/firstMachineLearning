one of my favourite domestic movies i dont know if there is any person in our country who hasnt seen this movie its funny and sad at some momentsi dont know how did people around the world who had opportunity to watch it accept this movie because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the 20th century to be able to understand it but as i see here there is somebody from canada who watched itand he liked itbr br i think that ill try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site but first to find out how to do thatbr br cheers
