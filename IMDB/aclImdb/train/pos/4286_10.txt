i saw this film its english title is whos singing over there at the 1980 montreal international film festival it won raves then and disappeared a terrible shame it is brilliant sublime ridiculous sad and extremely funny the script is a work of art its been 19 years and ive seen only a handful of comedies or any other genre for that matter that can match its originality
