i have to be 100 honest with you fellow imdb users i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster doesnt charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way im in love with that woman i got what i expectedbut only half this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situationsbr br while i dont agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated i must admit that pr√©temoi ta main has plenty of flawsbr br my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters there isnt a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of romance or even a clue to suggest that theyre interested in each otherbr br in fact the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward when both are in the couch and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest i didnt buy the dinner sequencebr br still the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these daysbr br i understand its a movie and thats why i accept it as a funny situation plus the humor is versatile there are moments involving sm funny lines with chabats best friend some lesbian references funny situations involving the family women and morebr br charlotte gaionsbourgs performance is top notch and shes by far the reason to watch the movie shes funny sexy looks very thin and fine and demonstrates shes a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliancebr br alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance i think the supporting cast do what they canbr br the score art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the filmbr br those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits its a good example of feel good cinema
