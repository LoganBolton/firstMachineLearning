alain chabat is a fine actor writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an idea credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when aristophanes was still learning that its i before e except after c but like i said chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to im also gradually overcoming an aversion to charlotte gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance if you absolutely insist on knowing the plot is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single this doesnt sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an arrangement with the sister of a colleague to pose  for fifteen thousand euros as his new girlfriend allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him thus getting him off the hook naturally they wind up together but along the way theres some subbenedek and beatrice duelling and all things considered its a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the french box office that a sequel may not be out of the question
