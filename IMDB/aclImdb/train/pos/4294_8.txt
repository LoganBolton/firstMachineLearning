there wasnt a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after i left the cinema having seen this gem of a film in a soldout house as part of this years hamburg film festival and the tears shed were all of laughter this film was hilarious theres no other way of saying this there wasnt one boring bit in it i laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of french cin√©mabr br alain chabat was absolutely terrific a great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it the performance was of course completely over the top but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well equally great was charlotte gainsbourg who i love to see a lot and the mother was also a very strong performance the sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character scriptwise but apart from that there is nothing to moan about i had a great afternoon seeing this film while hamburg was drowning in rain outside and i wish films like this from france would get a regular release in germany but the distributors is this country dont seem to understand that the french make good films i at least cant wait to find a dvd which offers subtitles hello australia please because that film i need at home to watch several more times
