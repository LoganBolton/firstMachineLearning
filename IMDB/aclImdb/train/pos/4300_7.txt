this film could well have been one of those ordinary soapies relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwinedbroken relationshipsbuilding new friendships street bashings near accidents hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes what a mixture of eventsbr br fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers he asksin this chaotic world do things just happen is it just luck when things turn out right or  taking a fatalistic view is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective most of us have had this uncanny experiencebr br is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important as one character says he once sat on the edge overlooking the grand canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he wasbr br this is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships danny glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role
