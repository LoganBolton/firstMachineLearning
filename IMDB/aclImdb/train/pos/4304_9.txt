i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 and at the time it shocked me i had seen a violent movie before but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence this movie not only shows this but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful crash tried to show how racism was bad and crash actually had a builtin anti asian bias and to come at it from a morally superior position grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash especially when you compare the endings the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note where you know nothing much will change in the characters lives but thats because life just goes on too theres no suitable ending no matter how goodbad you are there is no ending of a chapter to begin another
