well maybe not immediately before the rodney king riots but even a few months before was timely enough my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground it just goes to show the state of race relations in america the plot has white mack kevin kline and africanamerican simon danny glover becoming friends after simon saves macks life in the black ghetto meanwhile movie producer davis steve martin in a serious role thinks that gratuitous violence is really cooluntil he gets shot theres also some existentialism in the movie mack and his family come to realize that they arent living as they really wantbr br it seems that crash has somewhat renewed peoples interest in race relations but this one came out much earlier maybe well never be able to have stable race relations in this country but either way grand canyon is a great movie it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor also starring mary mcdonnell marylouise parker and alfre woodard
