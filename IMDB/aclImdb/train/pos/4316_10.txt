i have to say that grand canyon is one of the most affecting films ive ever seen ive watched it several times now and i still feel as i did the first time that this film by itself could make up the entire curriculum of a postgraduate course in film direction br br a long time ago film trailers used to promise itll make you laugh itll make you cry thats a very trite and shorthand method of describing what grand canyon does it takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell br br much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror its always a short step too just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial geniusbr br spoiler of sorts coming up after getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum the film throws a curve with a sequence that doesnt go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat through an accidental selfinflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house in the moment of their relief argument forgotten cut finger forgotten the earthquake survived a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed the couple rushes to his aid i cried when i saw this sequence i cried every time i saw it im crying now it isnt sadness that does this to me its not a particularly sad sequence what tears me up is that this few minutes of film was perfect thats perfect astounding end of spoilerbr br theres so much to say about grand canyon it portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously they arent showy or overblown and theres no long pause to examine the moment carefully the film moves on at the pace of life even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience br br grand canyon is a very human film
