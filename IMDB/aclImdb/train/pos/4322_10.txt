perhaps you wont care for the social commentary or the film makers point of view i myself am mystified at the insignificance angle kasdan seemed to promote  when clearly the actions taken in the movie promote certain significance the ending confused me however theres absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented the magnificent symbolism throughout the threaded character arcs visuals dialogue  is absolute masterwork ive watched the movie dozens of times and i still marvel at its perfection theres not a moment action cut or line that doesnt have everything to do with the theme realistic human performances from all the actors scene to scene its woven fantasticallybr br i have a pretty level sapmeter the buzzer never went off during this film if youre a thinker rather than a casual viewer  this movie delivers exponentially absolutely mesmerizing do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not was it interestingbr br personally the movie affected me  significantly in my top 5br br note the frontpage reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed african american perception what he may have failed to recognize is there was a hand  shake not a hand  out the spiritually dead white man simply saw a man to respect and admire and he did something about it the fact he was black had little if anything to do with it color is simply used to draw the parallel and the chasm its no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either if you view the blacks in this movie as token  you may want to reassess your angst you may be seeing only black and white yourself eh just a thought
