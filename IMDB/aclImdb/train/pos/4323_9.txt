this is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right the plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book but really how many modern readers have read bleak house without seeing a film version first i know of only a few br br i think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who havent a clue about the story  did you actually see the series or did you just bag a bbc production because gillian anderson was in the newer versionbr br the series captures the mood pace characters and plotdrivers cutting out the dickensian flourishes which arent needed and detract from a film treatment like the turveydrop story the smallweed family dynamic and the extra lawyers  tangle vholes etc are very truncated the only omission that i wish had been kept was the jellyby incident but as the first episode is already a trifle slow after the first episode the pace is perfect i can see it had to go br br the only other criticism i have is that jos death could have been more faithfully done i can see that would have practically canonized woodcourt and hes kept a little more human for not having that scene but really i think jos death is one of the most poignant points of the book and i missed it even though it always makes me crybr br has theowinthrop actually seen the series how did he think that esther was raised by her aunt and uncle who is this uncle i suppose someone who could mistake the name of denholm eliott for desmond isnt really an appreciator of english art film or literaturebr br i also think he mistakes the treatment of the law yes the law is drawn very badly in bleak house it fails the descendants of jarndyce whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of litigation it fails the deceased tom jarndyce and rick carstone and all who have faith in the suit it fails miss flyte in some sense it also fails captain hawdon who is driven to his death by the monotony of law copyist work yes it feeds the scavengers of vholes and tangle but it also makes men like guppy and kenge able to move beyond their station in life though not kind to social statusclimbers dickens clearly would have preferred that they werent bound to being stuck in the station to which they were born contrast jo and the brickmakers families to the climbing out of poverty by charley neckett br br also the law while misused by tulkinghorn and the chancery vultures is actually the source of security for the wards of the court ada and richard and for esther who is simply jarndyces ward their security was ensured by the law which delivers them to jarndycebr br i cant see how anyone could have trouble following the story  remember you arent supposed to realize esther is lady dedlocks daughter right at the beginning neither are you supposed to get all the connections immediately instant gratification just doesnt happen in dickensbr br as for seeing clearly through the fog  gosh the gillian anderson had such scatty editing that i found it impossible to follow and i knew the plot alreadybr br i found diana rigg absolutely brilliant overacting and drama dont make a good lady dedlock but if you think they do try the gillian anderson versionbr br its ada and rick not kate and you get all you need of the rouncewell subplot
