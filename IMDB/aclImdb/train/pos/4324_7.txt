you dont need to read this reviewbr br an earlier review by pninson of seattle has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production i can only amplify its basic argumentsbr br bleak house was a relatively late dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work this is taken too literally by the director ross devenish who piles on the gloom and fog too much when ada rick and esther appear half an hour into the opening episode it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time in some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my tv screen i watched the whole thing in one day starting in midafternoon as daylight faded this became less of an issue but i have a pretty good tv and i have never encountered this problem before at any time of daybr br the pacing is very deliberate ie slow i am sure this was intensional but it is overdone there are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of victorian london that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere a good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fiftyminute episode without losing a line of dialogue just by trimming each of these scenes slightlybr br i dont want to overstate these two problems you soon adjust to the look and pace of this production the more important issue is that it doesnt always tell the story very effectively earlier dickens novels are as long as bleak house but are not nearly so intricately plotted for example i recently reread nicholas nickleby because i was intrigued to see how douglas mcgrath crammed an 800 page book into his twohour movie the answer is simple the book is full of padding mcgrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements this would not be possible with bleak house br br this production needs its seven hours probably it needs even longer because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear or as well handled as they need to be a few random examples will illustrate the problemsbr br the maid rosa appears from nowhere with no background so lady dedlocks attachment to her is largely unmotivatedbr br sergeant georges acquiescence in tulkinhorns demand for a sample of hortons handwriting is somewhat fudgedbr br it is not made clear enough that esther is actually in love with woodcourt when she agrees to marry john jarndyce neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement or whybr br ada and ricks secret marriage is omitted in one episode they are merely lovers in the next people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wifebr br mrs rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and sargeant georges estrangement from his family is left unexplained  as is the means by which she is discoveredbr br tulkinhorns dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the dedlock family is understated so his motive for persecuting lady dedlock is more obscure than it need bebr br the involvement of the brick makers with both tom and later lady dedlock is somewhat opaquebr br it is not obvious that guppy renews his offer to esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanishedbr br this is only a selection there are others they are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough nonetheless they are minor irritations that detract from its power you shouldnt have to puzzle over little plot points however there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stagesbr br the whole business of tulkinhorns murder is somewhat thrown away bucket immediately pinpoints hortense as a suspect which undermines the suspense of sergeant georges predicament and the importance of finding mrs rouncewell it also diminishes the impact of the subplot in which suspicion is thrown on lady dedlock and weakens the scene in which hortense is unmasked in front of sir lesterbr br a more serious problem is that the murder its investigation and the subsequent search for lady dedlock dominate the story for over an hour during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand the legal case and its effect on rick his failing finances his gouging by vholes and skimpole adas despair his declining health and so on are all put on hold for an entire episode this may be how dickens wrote the book i havent read it for years but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward togetherbr br finally smallweeds role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous his discovery of the new will that triggers the final phase of the story is also thrown away it happens off screenbr br despite all of this it is still a very good production many of the performances are outstanding individual scenes are beautifully realised its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful i would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book had it not been for the 2005 production in fact i probably wouldnt be fully aware of its defects if i hadnt seen how andrew davies did it better i have been critical of daviess jane austen adaptations but i have to admit that he really knows how to tame dickenss sprawling booksbr br this is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybodys time nonetheless its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a crossreference to the neardefinitive 2005 version
