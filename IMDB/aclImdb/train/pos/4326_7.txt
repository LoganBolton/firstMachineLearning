i cant say how closely the film follows the novel never having read the book but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours its a good bet that most of the base are covered or at least we can say with some certainty that this isnt a readers digest condensed versionbr br the production values are high well up to the standards of other bbc classic series like inspector morse and sherlock holmes we can believe dickens london looked sounded and thought a lot like this there are some occasional minor lapses  some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took placebr br the acting too is to be applauded suzanne burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good shes cute too in a mature way her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness denholm elliott is her guardian and more than that as it turns out burden and elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people another is a poor and helpless young boybr br i dont think anyone else could have written this its got all the earmarks of dickens  poverty tragic deaths capitalism in the raw the generous rich guy in his gated home hidden parentage shadowy motives and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system well not the justice system as a whole but the chancery which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property so i gather from wikipedia it became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in england in 1973 twice elliotts character describes it as a curse the most impressive scene involves a moneyscrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latters gymnasium during a fencing lesson the sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character i remember from dickens the apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor while the scarletfaced old creditor shrinks back into his seatbr br a couple of things are missing often dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog humbug or the law is a ass not here bleak house is the right title second there are practically no weberian ideal types  no mr micawbers or artful dodgers or scrooges third the atmosphere the whole ethos is relentlessly dismal one tribulation follows another usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the pastbr br my god its depressing its as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew poverty okay he knew poverty but one wonders what the chancery did to dickens to deserve this kind of treatmentbr br maybe i should add that ive just watched the first episode of the 2005 series  and its better in two ways there is more zip in the direction so the pace is a little faster and the business of jarndyce vs jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious curse so the plot is easier to follow
