the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships  first and foremost an adult son and his father but also that son with his wife his sisters and his mother paul reiser has written a semiautobiographical movie about his relationship with his father the movie is funny poignant and thoughtprovoking it led me to reevaluate my own relationship with both my nowdeceased father and my adult son peter falk is excellent as pauls father  the role could not have been better cast i hope that both mr falk and mr reiser are recognized in next years movie awards for their efforts  falk for his performance and reiser for his script
