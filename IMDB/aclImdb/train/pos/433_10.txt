this is one of those rare movies its lovely and compelling dignified and quirky a true gift i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience yup find the magic i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film further the costumes if youre drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done i just wish theyd release it on dvd because im wearing my tape version out br br absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions
