who doesnt have unresolved issues with parents and which parents dont have unresolved issues with each otherbr br i know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better ive always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first scenebr br especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person and peter falks monologue about being a hardworking sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interestingbr br nicely done paul and peter
