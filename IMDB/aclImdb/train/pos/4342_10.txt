this movie didnt really surprise me as such it just got better and better i thought paul rieser wrote this huh wellwell see how he does then i saw peter falk was in it i appreciate colombo even though i was never a big fan of the show ive always liked watching peter falk br br the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment and i hadnt even been drinkingbr br this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it but i couldnt find his number must be unlisted or somethingbr br this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything it just came on and i thoughteh why not lets see if i dont like it  i dont have to watch it and i ended up just loving it
