it is no wonder this movie won 4 prices it is a movie that lingers to any soul it isnt a wonder why it took paul reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea i can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousandsbr br story 1010 when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost friendship family and affection for each other at the beginning you know whats going to happen but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife it is no wonder it took paul reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romancecomedybr br actors 1010 well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with peter falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use peter falk in a romancecomedy what do you think you get a perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices as the son paul reiser does an excellent job although he isnt a great actor always that doesnt mean that this didnt work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son the rest of the cast is good enough but you dont see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more br br music 1010 it doesnt always work when using music sometimes it just doesnt fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a romancecomedy thats for surebr br overall 1010 there are so many romancecomedy movies out on tapes dvds bluray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesnt happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made
