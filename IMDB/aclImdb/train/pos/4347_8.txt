i wont go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same groundbr br just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much peter falks performance alone is reason enough to watch the filmbr br a small scale road trip movie with falk  paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the filmbr br very well written with an adult target audience in mind plenty of reality based humor  some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own familybr br really cant say enough about this film except that its a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesnt get more exposure while other trashy junk out there doesbr br its great to see falk with a big leading man role again  he makes the most of it it proves that his famous friend  writerdirector john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s  70s
