three girls the youngest descendents of the gaylord family one of americas most royal families are orphaned at a young age right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi their father tells the oldest fiona never to sell the land by the time the sisters have become adults they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property through certain loopholes in the fathers will a man named charles barclay stands to gain possession of the gaylord land on which he wants to build a complex called barclay circle barclay is actually based on john d rockefeller who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in new york so he could build rockefeller centerbr br this film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters fiona well played by barbara stanwyck although its certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles seems like a cold domineering woman and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet susanna played by nancy coleman is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young colemans was my favorite performance in the film evelyn played by geraldine fitzgerald is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in england but that doesnt stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister the three sisters are developed quite well but as is the major trend in the gay sisters never well enough charles barclay is played by george brent he isnt very good well he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have but he always seems like a scumbag in the film when were asked to sympathize with him late in the film its impossible gig young is played by huh gig young no hes not playing himself what happened is that the actor who had acted in several movies previously under his real name byron barr was pressured by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy im not sure who made the final choice but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters weird eh young is quite good through most of the film but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audiences sympathy for him in two other supporting roles helen thimig and gene lockhart are quite goodbr br the gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas the characters are all interesting as are their situations unfortunately the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama if it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex fleshed out for example the rivalry between evelyn and susanna or made the flashback more intricate the film could have been fantastic it also could have fleshed out the prologue more let us know more about the gaylord family we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more and the ending needed some major fixing it basically just gives up at the end fionas problems are solved so poorly that it hurts whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart its also far too happy this story seems moving towards tragedy or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss and we still hate barclay and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved as bad as fionas story ends susannas gigs and evelyns is even worsebr br i still liked the film its thoroughly watchable even if it doesnt involve us like other great films of the era 710 mostly for its potential it should have been remade or the novel should have been readapted at some point during the studio era it is too dated to be remade now the 1950s would have been the best time during the time of films like giant
