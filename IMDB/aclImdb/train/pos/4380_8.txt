this is a very good underrated actiondramaand slightly historical moviebr br the basic story concerns rob roys borrowing of 1000 pounds its theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmenbr br cunningham tim roth is an amazing villain and character in this story brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evilbr br rob roy liam neeson is excellent too but i think the writers used the word honour 1 too many timesbr br the rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well acted and filmedbr br the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic but not too gory the story is good and you really want rob to winbr br all in all just shy of a classic
