major spoilers this is for people who have seen the moviebr br commenters have touched on the major theme of honor in the film and too many comparisons to braveheart ill point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch onbr br this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion the first character to get pregnant is the villains roth girlfriend and when he coldly suggests an abortion she states it is too late for that the shame of her situation im to have a bastards bastard leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene the second character to find herself pregnant is mary robs wife after a rape by roths character and at least one sex scene with her husband rob late in the movie as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins with a tone hinting of abortion rob replies in a noble tone its not the fault of the child and then states what he thinks the name should be girl or boy i find this prolife stance on the part of the hero to be very unhollywood rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment  not coincidental symbolismbr br another related theme is roths character is a bastard someone who evidently does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck is it coincidence that roth devoid of family stability is the walking definition of psychopath while rob is the strong husbandfather figure and of course the hero in the final sword fight between rob and the villain roth the former slices the latter deeply across the chest  the left side of the chest over the heart his employer and pseudofather figure john hurt character holds the mothers picture in his hand and gazes at it before snatching it from the neck of the dead rothbr br also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene which was not quite graphic but neither was it offcamera and implied i found it surprising in its somewhat matter of fact depiction with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post traumatic stress as we call it now my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to takebr br in the final fight scene i have to correct an earlier commenter the weapon roth chose was a rapier or perhaps a short sword the weapon rob chose was a claymore someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene roth would have the upper hand in such a situation but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon what is even more striking to me as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made the actors seem actually trying to kill each other  not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights including the movies opening fight even more true to history roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon which is its purpose by design rapiers were edged but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust rob uses the claymore in broad slashes as its design intent the fight goes down as i would expect it to  roth effectively wins though rob wins the day by grabbing roths weapon more symbolism and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cutbr br folks it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fightbr br ill also note that for whatever reason i remember 1995 the year of release distinctly as a time of distrust of the us government hollywood was obviously tuned into that with the release of both rob roy and braveheart and i think the antigovernment leanings are why both films get so much comparison br br i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans tired of the same old not so hidden messages from hollywood
