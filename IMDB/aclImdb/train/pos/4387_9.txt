this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward in truth it is the standard story of a simple honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the periodbr br poor vs rich honorable vs dishonorable a classic but welltold tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screenbr br extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen
