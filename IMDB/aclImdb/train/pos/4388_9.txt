michael catonjoness scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same namebr br the film opens in the scottish highlands with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james grahams cattle the scene then switches to a swordfighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface makeup and conventional gesturesbr br macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose when he enters an illadvised trade agreement with montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montroses evildoers the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the bladebr br liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character he is intelligent fair and virile he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community he is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains hed rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust br br oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat langes lines are filled with dignity and integrity i will think on you dead until my husband makes you so and then i will think on you no morebr br john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the english courts fashion for foppery he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service honor in his view seems a quaint notion he has two objectives ruin the reputation of his rival the duke of argyle and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders homes to kill their people and their livestockbr br tim rothÂ—the perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer he is a penniless british aristocrat a nasty hired sword wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist his name is archibald cunningham he turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer he dismisses himself as but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore cant care about anyone else love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girlbr br cunningham seems pathetic he smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmfuluntil a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that hes a cool head and an expert with a sword he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nominationbr br and while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn andrew keir is montroses rival the powerful local aristocrat the duke of argyll one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family br br set in 18thcentury scotland and with an atmospheric musical score rob roy is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by mel gibsons braveheart that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords
