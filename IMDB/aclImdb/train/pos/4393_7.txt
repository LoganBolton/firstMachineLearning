ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film to catch action characters and setting on the hoof as they emerge covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia unformed in mind or manhood this is an ideal approach the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities adulthood and relationships lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the midsouth as a silent character enduring the strife like a hardy parentbr br james schamus script is probably the standard bearer for this film close behind it are a number of wellappointed performances that carry it admirably jeffrey wrights name alone could carry this film for me hes brilliant here but in a slow burning role instead we are treated to very good if not revelatory performances from a large often recognisable ensemblebr br a noble optimistic film one to watch if you dont fancy the harder more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim for example 710
