so neighbor was killing neighbor reminds me of iraq as i watched the american flag 50 stars in 1864 being dragged behind the horse i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesnt upset me as much as our destructionindifference to the bill of rights im a southerner and must have some historical memorybr br watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans his ethnic background being wagered at a poker gamewas interesting many twists in this movie the wife who is forced into her marriage shows both lust and a strong will characteristics were not used to seeing in respectable victorian southern bellesbr br the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin head of the copeland horsethieving gang inc in mississippi was hung about that time bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside armed remind you of iraq and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background and why southerners are still fighting that civil war todaybr br too bad we cant use that same knowledge in our handling of the country weve just invaded and are occupying fomenting civil war everywhere thats mesopotamia now called iraq who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil the wildeyed killers in missouri raiding lawrence kansas could as easily be the insurgents were fighting now with no successbr br another anomaly was the fathers tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school even before they erect a church and for that reason theyll win huh i was taught history in birmingham al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richerthats why they won course they also literally had god on their side as you see here when the freed slave indicates that hes cutting out to free his mother sold into slavery in texas god what a horrible legacy slavery gave usbr br acting pretty good lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle but didnt hear any rebel yells so reminiscent of football games in alabama you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid they have lost sight of why theyre fighting and so do we just more mindless slaughterbr br youre also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq as the bushwacker ahh what connotations first has his arm seared shut trying to save it then has it amputated and then dies so much suffering for such a stupid causebr br the cinematography is fantastic now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes one of my favorite parts of any movie i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era if you knew history the dialogue is definitely thoughtprovoking not your ordinary blood and guts war movie by any means you see the wounded but still activeduty soldiers still fighting cause they have nothing else to do you see the southern raiders living off the land stealing indiscriminately yet at the beginning youve seen the battle stop so the women could be evacuated from danger as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq im thinking where did we lose our sense of honor as a people i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years but some book somewhere lauded it with good reason tobey at his best prespideyman buy the dvd or rent it and tell me why others laud this not just liberals cest moi
