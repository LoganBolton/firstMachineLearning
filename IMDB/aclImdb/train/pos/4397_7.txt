an unconventional historical drama with some fine battle scenes tobey maguire gives an excellent performance and gets some pretty good backup the script is literate and pretty original and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes that said it does drag a bit and the last reel is too much like a tv miniseries still frederick elmess camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch worth seeing
