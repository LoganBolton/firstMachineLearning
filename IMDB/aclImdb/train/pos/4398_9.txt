when i heard this film was directed by ang lee i made sure to see it this taiwanese director burst into fame with the wedding banquet and eat drink man woman a few years ago and then moved on to sense and sensibility and the ice storm now he turns his attention to another american icon  the civil warbr br this story takes place in missouri a union state with southern sympathies these never officially joined the confederate army instead they formed outlaw bands called bushwhackers grew they hair long and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothingbr br the movie depicts their moral dilemma the high drama of the times and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union there are no stars in this movie unless you consider jewel the singer well cast as a young confederate widow as a starbr br tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers this young man is an excellent actor full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as hes exposed to the horror of warbr br jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom he gives a fine and understated performancebr br some of the acting however is wooden especially in the long conversations they have about morality and their costumes are too new and the southern gentleman theme of manners and hattipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much  especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their womens arms then burn down the stores and housesbr br while i dont think that this will go down as one of lee angs great movies i did find myself fascinated by it in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of historybr br not as much action as the usual war movie but yet still recommended  especially for civil war buffsbr br
