i saw this film and heard the writerdirector juan gerard speak at the santa barbara intl film festivalbr br all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8yearold boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and familybr br its opening scene will bring to mind cinema paradiso in fact the film is filled with references to classic films the roulette wheel casablanca chicken clucking rebel without a cause references to bunuel touch of evil youll find more the homeless man georg stanford brownis a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorusbr br what this film really is is the culmination of a dream gerards wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his lifebr br this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are realas are the events depicted gerard is actually an architect and engineer and passionate film lover but his dream was to make this movie he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an angel who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather che brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast iben hjejle high fidelity and gael garcia bernal y tu mama tambien offer strong support in key rolesbr br truthfully the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines and some overracting but stay with it the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax it is the first effort of juan gerard but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come throughin this sincere first effort i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film careerbr br
