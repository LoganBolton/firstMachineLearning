this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isnt easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasnt captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved toddao technicolor and the very finest sound format availablean intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i cant stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more oftenbr br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people makeit is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you dont get it perhaps you havent lived enough or something else is wrong with you
