another attempt by modern japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre successful and not in varying degreesbr br buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary and very active demon at the gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment while not at the forefront buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie much like kurosawas ran it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although its nowheres near rans league br br stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length the lead actors are uniformly excellent the music is really good the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry closeups this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat another recent film like this is tsui harks seven swords great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing asano really doesnt move like a sword wielding demon his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scenebr br good movie youll probably find it interesting just dont expect traditional sword fights
