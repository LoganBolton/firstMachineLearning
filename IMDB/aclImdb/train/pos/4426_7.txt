i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the directors other films in the past i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handledbr br i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes they were hard to follow at timesbr br ultimately a moral tale it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film it is a film i would like to see againbr br some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a psychic level were well donebr br i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here intense
