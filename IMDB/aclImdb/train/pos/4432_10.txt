i happily admit that im a sucker for a beautiful film and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film not one the length of gojoe though even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography ive seen since the korean period piece musa however gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images as does musa dont which to imply a contrast  its second greatest strength is superb acting and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way vague ones but definitely thoughts pbr br one department in which the film could have been better is the action theres a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic closeups and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground it does create some very intense and impressive visuals but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyonebr br still the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films ive seen for quite some time recommended
