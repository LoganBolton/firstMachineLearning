this is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time it has all the right ingredients  a mystery corpse a weary middleaged cop corrigan walter kinsella and his rookie sidekick tobin john miles a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the tobin in the shape of a female botanist mary patricia wright who helps solve the crime theres also a terrific shootout finale which takes place in a stone cutters yardbr br watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where lt corrigan refers to the dead woman as tatooed tilly before the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo confusing huh also later when tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point  no wonder he didnt catch him
