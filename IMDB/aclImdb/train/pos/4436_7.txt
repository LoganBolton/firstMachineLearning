the tattooed stranger was another of those rare bmovies that bbc2 screened over christmasnew year 20052006 see also they live by night and the brighton stranglerbr br in this one a man walking his dog in central park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside she was shot and police then try to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue after being identified the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the endbr br most of this movie was shot on location in and around new york so we get to see some areas of the city we dont normally see especially the back streetsbr br mostly unknowns are in the cast with john miles getting top billingbr br the tattooed stranger is worth seeking out excellent but rather obscurebr br rating 3 stars out of 5
