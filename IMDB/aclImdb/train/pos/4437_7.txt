this police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few obviously it is following in the steps of dragnet and naked city but emerges as an enjoyable programmer the best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gonethe lower class new york of the late 40searly 50s here it is in all its seedy glory from the oldschool tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons these old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized soulless cityscape of todaybr br also intriguing is the emphasis on the nutsandbolts scientific aspect of solving the crimein this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car our main heroes detectives tobin and corrigan do the footwork but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the lab boys theyd get nowhere although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the dogged persistence of a csi investigator to track down their manbr br the way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by ed wood and acted by extras from his movies what bosh i enjoyed john miles as the gangly exmarine turned cop tobinhe had a happygolucky easygoing approach to the role thats a welcome change from the usual stonefaced histrionics of most movie cops of the period patricia barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime walter kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective corrigan i rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic dragnet approachbr br the mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shootout certainly wont rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during its brief running time the tattooed stranger more than held my interest
