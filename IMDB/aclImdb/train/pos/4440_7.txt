the ogre doesnt seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle demons 3 in order to help it sell better well the film is directed by lamberto bava the man behind the first two demons films and ogres and demons are somewhat alike in that theyre both monsters anywaybut other than that this film has no connections to the other two films it is however rather good italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films and while its not completely obvious it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from hellraiser the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement its not long after moving into the castle before these visions returnand it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe theres a murderous ogre living in the basementbr br the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant but for what it is this is certainly a very decent horror film lamberto bava may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well the central setting a large castle makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and lamberto makes the best of it even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times such as the infernostyle pool scene the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange particularly between the husband and wife theres not a great deal of bloodshed but bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects the ogre itself looks really silly and its a good job that we dont get to see it very often we do boil down to a fitting if highly predictable ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended
