alright before we review i have to ask why isnt this listed individually it may have been merely a tv item in italy but to international lamberto bava fans this is its own film in america this film is distributed on vhs and dvd as either the ogre or demons 3 yes i know it has nothing to do with demons apart from one cast member and the crew but yes i personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so usefulbr br finally lets review the ogre ive seen the trailer for this many times on youtube and honestly found that rather scary the movie itself it is feature length therefore making it a movie has many many strong parts and does manage to scare i was displeased by the last act but on the whole i dont regret having bought the dvd before seeing it available from shriek show i guess the films tv origins explain the last act i wont give out any spoilersbr br the plot is somewhat familiar an american horror writer vacationing at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares there are faint echoes of the shining but this is a different brand of supernatural horror the woman virginia bryant finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares but her husband wont believe her great atmosphere and terror followbr br the multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky the ogre cocoon effect was good it reminded me a bit of uncle franks resurrection from the first hellraiser theres also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene i give them props that the film never stooped to imitating american films with similar concepts namely a nightmare on elm street the ogre is an original and the monster itself was a scary one when it was presented correctlybr br on the shriek show dvd there is a lamberto bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic demons series he also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed indeed this setting contributes a lot to the film the simon boswell music helps toobr br theres lots of good stuff here the ogre is not perfect but it is very much worth seeing take it is a lesser lamberto bava achievement
