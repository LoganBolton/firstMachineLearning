the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasnt intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series the music in demons and demons 2 was 80s rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii the ogre is a architectural horror so thats how demons iii isnt a proper sequel to demons but i still like this filmbr br the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in the ogre is another thing why i like the film there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons demoni 3 and the church demons 3 demons iii the ogre is a good film as long as you dont compare it with demons and demons 2
