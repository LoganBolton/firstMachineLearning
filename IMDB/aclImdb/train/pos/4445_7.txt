this early sirk melodrama shot in black and white is a minor film yet showcases the flair of the german director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art set in the 1910s barbara stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her smalltown husband and family for the lure of the chicago stage she never fulfilled her ambitions and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre a high school production that is back in her old town she once again comes up against smallmindedness and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter bewildered and boring husband richard carlson and exlover the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions with every frame carefully shot and he is aided immeasurably by having stanwyck as his leading lady it runs a crisp 76 minutes and thats just as well because the material doesnt really have the legs to go any further
