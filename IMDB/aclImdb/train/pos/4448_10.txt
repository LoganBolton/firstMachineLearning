saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it im a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotalclimatic happened in a scene br br i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking  at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughters boyfriend and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasnt seen in ten years and with the gunshot signal two shots and then one she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch the reason she left town in the first place all at the same time the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50sbr br love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue  just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the bunny hug is good enough reason to rent this film on dvdbr br one of the best films from that period ive seen in a long time
