anchors aweigh is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by jule styne and others excellent dancing by gene kelly and even a passable job by frank sinatra and a funny wellpaced script the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudooperatic warbling from the petite missbr br kelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentinocharms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middleamerican name of clarence sinatra upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving clarences life joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life they are drafted by a policeman rags ragland who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy dean stockwell who wants to join the navy into returning home to aunt susan grayson at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing aunt susan but eventually kellys character emerges as the more likely candidatebr br there are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kellys more famous work in films like singin in the rain and american in paris the closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with kellys character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry the mouse from tom and jerry although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse its a startling sequence for its time but doesnt have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation where kelly was using semiballetic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of alice in wonderlandbr br eventually the characters find their way to susans favorite bar a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurantbar in tijuana there the patrons happily allow ms grayson to chirp her arias with abandon and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their friend jose iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch of course theyve never met their friend iturbi and they spend much of the films length trying to reach him in an amusing scene sinatras character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you havent seen anything like this outside of 1000 fingers of dr t iturbi himself is a kind of a godfigure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine everyone is 100 sure that as soon as mr iturbi so much as hears ms grayson her operatic career will be a reality the 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the films charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very downtoearth real mannerisms of the maestro and speaking of iturbis contributions to the film he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of donkey serenadebr br when all is said and done this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss the majority of the music was written for this film a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like rain and american kelly is still at his early peak adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character sinatras voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing stockwell is a charming addition to the clan and graysons character is endearing when she isnt posturing on stage iturbi adds that wellgrounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classicera mgm musical this is one of the better ones
