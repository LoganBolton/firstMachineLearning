two sailors are on leaveladies man joseph brady gene kelly and shy innocent clarence doolittle frank sinatra they meet beautiful susan abbott kathryn grayson and both fall in love with her theres more but youve probably guessed itbr br the story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesomegets annoying pretty quick also this movie is far too long its 140 minutes and thats way too much for such a silly story there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra still this is worth catchingbr br when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you wont care its shot in rich technicolor with all the gloss mgm had the acting is okkelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and sinatra is just great although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too grayson is given nothing to do but shes incredibly beautiful to look at some shots of her literally took my breath away there are plenty of highlights here sinatra and kellys big dancing and singing number sinatra singing anything graysons two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerryan animated mouse tom does a funny cameo too also theres little dean stockwell who steals every scene hes inbr br so its too long and the plot just doesnt hold up but its still worth catching this was a huge hit in its day
