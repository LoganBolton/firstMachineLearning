the only reason i give this movie 810 stars and not 10 is because 1 sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of kellys character leaves much to be desired imho do love that dean stockwell quantum leap  al is the little boy the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughters im 28 and shes 4 so while the character is less iconic than mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement in every movie i have ever seen him in he always steals the show one of the best dancers of the 20th century it is no wonder paula abdul sampled kellys moves i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century if you were to watch only one part dont miss kellys dance with jerry mouse you will not be disappointed
