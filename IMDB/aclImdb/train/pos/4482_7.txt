anchors aweigh sees two eager young sailors joe brady gene kelly and clarence doolittlebrooklyn frank sinatra get a special fourday shore leave eager to get to the girls particularly joes lola neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the interruption of little navymad donald dean stockwell and his aunt susie kathryn grayson unexperienced in the ways of females and courting brooklyn quickly enlists joe to help him win aunt susie over along the way however joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal and does joe end up with susie who loves him toobr br the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town the kellysinatra collaboration from 1949 both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them yet both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall having now seen both films a third time i still stand by that judgement somehow on the town as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter gayer purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh im not quite sure why this is the typical argument is that the latter film is overlong at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it however its also a film that grows on youthe more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making and yet something just doesnt hang together quite right it feels almost as if the script was pored over and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted and thats exactly what happened no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up and thats probably the films biggest weakness it has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra this really starts to turn one numb after a while contrast this for example with the ten numbers in on the town you might well feel that each song each dance cant be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking and thats true but thats also because the writers werent more restrained in adding them in in the first placebr br all this long preamble doesnt mean theres nothing good about anchors aweigh the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over like the duets between kelly and sinatra we hate to leave i begged her and if you knew susie the singing of sinatra what makes the sunset the charm of you and the best of all i fall in love too easily and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of kelly its also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbis role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it even clarences own brooklyn pamela britton is cute and charming as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town his singing is as usual simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing his solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when youve got the voice of a century showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the filmbr br gene kellys sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively anchors aweigh really is kellys film his joe brady is a believable real characterhes tough on the outside glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but hes actually the biggest softy on the inside kelly makes this charming rather than cloying but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands and the dancingagain the film suffers from the too much of a good thing spoils the effect syndrome as it does with sinatras singing but once again if its gene kelly doing the softshoe or tapping across the screen in a sailors outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief might as well err on the side of overdoing it all of kellys dances are breathtaking be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to i begged her his mexican hat dance with the sweet wideeyed little girl or his lavish spanishinfluenced dance la cumparsita of course the classic image left in audiences minds for all time would be kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with jerry mouse of tom  jerry fame a welldeserved golden film memory to be sureits not often that one can say youre impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market but gene and jerry still look great with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation br br its doubtless that this first daring inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs but its also notable for being the first of three kellysinatra film collaborations and though rather too drawnout still a great couple of hours of entertainment watch it first then again and maybe againitll grow on you before you realise it 7510
