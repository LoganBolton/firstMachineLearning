released some months before the end of the war anchors aweigh is one of gene kellys major musical triumphs of the forties br br under the direction of george sidney it had the benefits of a pleasant score andbest of allthe services of gene kelly in his first true starring role at mgm the year before in columbias cover girl he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen a light but agreeable singing voice and considerable charm in anchors aweigh although he was billed under frank sinatra and kathryn grayson he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at mgm br br the films story a kind of dry run for on the town four years later follows sailors kelly and sinatra on shore leave spend their holiday in hollywood where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer grayson and her little nephew dean stockwellbr br grayson it appears has her heart set on an audition with conductorpianist jose iturbi she gets the audition of course kelly gets grayson after some misunderstandings and sinatra has forgotten to be shy and has lost his heart to a girl from brooklyn pamela brittonbr br the plot is conventional for the period but regrettably it now seems barely tolerable but there is gene kelly who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality perhaps he grins too much but when is permitted to dance the film finally lifts off the ground br br i begged her his early song and dance with sinatra is amusing and slightly absurd in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a spanish courtyard courting maiden grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps he also does a charming mexican dance with little sharon mcmanus in the square of a mexican settlement in los angelesbr br the highlight of the movie however is kellys famous dance with the cartoon character jerry the mouse of tom and jerry fame delightful and innovative it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until kelly a sailor in the pomeranian navy wearing a striped shirt and a beret shows him how to dance look at me im dancin says the gleeful mouse king
