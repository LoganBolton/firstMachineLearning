this is my favorite of the older tom  jerry cartoons from the early 40s the original version with mammy two shoes is on the tom  jerry spotlight collection 2 set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons the gags on this one arent all madcap avery style but more subtle and aimed at anyone whos ever stayed up late watching scary movies or radio programs tom is listening to a creepy radio show and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him the ninelives gag is well done here and i dont know how many times i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when i was a kid when toms owner is awakened by the ruckus mammy was not the maid it was her house she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh get your pause button ready its worth it
