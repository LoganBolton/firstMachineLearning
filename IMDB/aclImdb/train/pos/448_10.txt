i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and im not referring only to the breathtaking scenery its about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace theyre longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of lottie josie lawrence and lady caroline polly walker
