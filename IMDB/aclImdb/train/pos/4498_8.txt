francesca annis michael kitchen and robson green wow what a triook so this is no anna karenina but it is a good love story very wellwritten and wellacted by all even a few laughoutloud moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity age bias and parental agingalzheimers issuesbr br quirky guitar music added to the story as wellbr br while i have been a fan of ms annis since lillie in the 70s and mr kitchens since the buccaneers and enchanted april i have only recently discovered mr green me and mrs jones touching evil etc making me ask the question  why had i not seen reckless until recently admittedly more of a chick flick than something a man will sit through it is perfect for a rainy afternoons lazy viewing
