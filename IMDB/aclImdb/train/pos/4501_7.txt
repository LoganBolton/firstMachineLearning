this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch the supporting cast could form a series of their own its a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery his wife and a new pretty boy surgery resident only the superior acting skills of francesca annis michael kitchen and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable romp the only quibble is that its hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen who like me is hardly an international or even a british sex symbol you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire with apologies to the doors the guy who almost steals the show with a great laid back performance is owens father david bradley watch him in the way we live now in a completely different performance to get an idea of his range daniela nardini as kitchens secretary sometime sex toy is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body conor mullen and julian rhindtutt as greens sidekick surgery buddies as ive said could have their own series they are that good the whole thing is a great deal of fun and i heartily recommend it and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue
