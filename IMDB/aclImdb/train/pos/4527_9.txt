one of the ten best comedies ever br br this seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings keatons comedies are innerly harmoniously intelligently ordered thoughtbr br wonderfully amusing deliberately delightful and inventive three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one a threefold love story will enchant the viewers i want to bring here this approachkeatons comedy is like langs destiny upsidedownor à rebours again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the stone age in rome and in keatons timesin a mohammedan country in renaissance italy and in china the same device works in the both moviesone a grim eerie melodrama the other a light virtuouslypaced comedy at keaton its essentially the same couple and maybe the same is with lang the babe desired by both buster and beery is nice i have found three ages well written and smart without being ostentatiously sophisticated the plot is basically very popeyelikethe babe is a piece of furniture the only protagonists are the two male rivalskeaton and beerybr br keatons movie is simply enormously likable and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet its not but it is grand fun large fun ample fun and wallace beery makes a fine nemesis
