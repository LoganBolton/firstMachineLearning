dw griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of the birth of a nation he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date intolerance he took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form and the wellknown financial train wreck resulted buster keaton doesnt take that kind of a risk with three ages a parody of intolerance this is keatons first featurelength film of his own he only acted in the saphead he had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts which griffith did do with intolerance keaton didnt have to chaplin had already succeeded with featurelength comedies so if keaton was taking a risk here it was completely calculatedbr br chaplin had already done a parody of another film too with burlesque on carmen 1915 keaton appears to allude to that film as well the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in chaplins film the comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same too furthermore chaplins film imitated the glossy style of demilles carmen and chaplins film seemed a tribute to that film keaton doesnt attempt the radical editing narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody but it seems respectful of intolerance nonetheless at least the stories arent told completely straightforward as in other postintolerance films such as dreyers leaves from satans book blade af satans bog 1921 and fritz langs destiny der m√ºde tod 1921 there is some mild jumping back and forth between episodesbr br where keaton did take risks however is in his physical daredevil comedy thats keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode reportedly he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again and it wasnt just keaton who took risks the anachronistic baseball gag for example was rather dangerous thus although in a different way keaton like griffith took risks with his big film and i think they both succeeded
