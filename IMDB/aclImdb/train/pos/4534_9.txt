loosely intended as a satire of dw griffiths intolerance the three ages was buster keatons first attempt at a full length comedy feature the only similarities to intolerance are the opening book scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film keatons reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it didnt succeed as a feature film it could be reduced to three tworeelers fortunately the three ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines ive seen in any of keatons film there is nothing unique or daring about the story lines they are simple boymeetsgirl boylosesgirl boygetsgirl plots but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by mel brooks and all films of this genre however i dont believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy no one can play the lovable goof like keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best in addition wallace beerys appearance as keatons rival adds to this films appeal anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920s cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie
