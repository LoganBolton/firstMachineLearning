i saw the film for the first time at bbc on july the 27 of 2005 for me it was a good interpretation of the person conan doyleand i truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it i also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentionedyou may ask yourself was ac doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question however he was the creator of the famous holmesbut how much of it was a sort of semibiography not the less i strongly put this adaption forward it is a movie you have to see  even if you arent interested in the sherlock holmes movies or books  look a it  enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it
