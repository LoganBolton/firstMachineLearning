i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too dont invite the kids though this movie is very lowkeybr br seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a preraphaelite paintingbr br lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
