well no i tell a lie this is in fact not the best movie of all time but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seenbr br its a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat moritamr miyagi with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something but that doesnt matter the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends the whole culture difference thing is done quite wellin that its fun to watch its completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way the soundtrack is coolonce again in a cheesy 80s kind of way it suits the movie ive been trying to find one of the songs for ages but as im working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i cant seem to find itbr br another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever but i wont give that one away oh no in conclusion id take this movie over 48 hoursmost of eddie murphys output including beverly hills cop and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names if youre looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop give this a shot you might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with straight japanese cop meets zany streetwise white copbr br im giving this 7 to be honest i like it more than that id rather watch this than a lot of stuff id give 8 but i guess i know deep down that its some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie
