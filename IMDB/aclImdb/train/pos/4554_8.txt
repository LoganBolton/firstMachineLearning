there arent many overcomingtheodds stories quite like that of christy brown born with cerebral palsy in 1930s dublin his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical though eventually properly diagnosed brown in a lower workingclass family with nearly 20 children had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family through the use of his only fullyfunctioning limb his left leg he taught himself to write and paint both skills he developed expertly br br but what makes the film version of browns autobiography my left foot such a great retelling is its humility both directorwriter jim sheridan and star daniel daylewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesnt scream for attention and resort to melodrama cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous yet my left foot stays real and intrinsically inspiredbr br daylewis is the easiest to highlight playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task not only does daylewis give us a very complete picture of christy but he also manages to chronicle the growth improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life he plays christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned christy who struggles to cope with why he cant find nonplatonic love the latter theme is the films strongest and it wouldve been nice for sheridan and coadapter shane connaughton to really flesh that out regardless daylewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements giving a performance thats so believable you often dont have time to think wow hes such a great actor those are the most commendable performancesbr br equally important but through more subtle means is sheridans work on the film this story is about daytoday life and struggles although christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life his struggles are not unlike our own and sheridan grasps that concept completely christy struggles with love parental attention questions of self worth and capability his struggles are just more physically manifested literally and figuratively than ours br br sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large brown family and christys unique place in it the drama evolves naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way the dinner scene when christy learns that his doctorteacher  the woman he loves  is going to marry his brother peter is the films finest example of both daylewis and sheridans efforts its built up to so well by sheridan that it comes out when were ready and daylewis takes us from there with his stunning workbr br the other strong component of the film is brenda fricker as mrs brown i did not know shed won the oscar but there was something about her performances as christys loving and wise mother that just screamed oscarworthy her love for christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situationbr br the emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human the two should be reconcilable but i imagine its challenging to tell a story that feels truetolife and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster the choice to downplay the latter was definitely the wise one for my left foot browns circumstances speak for themselves  they dont need to be squeezed for weightier dramatic impactbr br steven cbr br visit my site moviemusereviewscom for more
