my left foot in my opinion is a great biopic about one of the worlds most talented authors and painters the performances were smashing the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect i thought that christy daniel daylewis was a very talented man although i couldnt understand what he was saying most of the time in addition when he threw a tantrum i got a little scared also its just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy in conclusion if you are a diehard fan of daniel daylewis or like biopics i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the worlds most talented authors and painters youre in for a real treat and a good time so dont miss this one
