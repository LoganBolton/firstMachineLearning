my older sister was born in march of 1985 and has cerebral palsy in her 22 years of life she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids i have been the butt of everyones jokes because my sister is disabled and i still think to this day that nobody is or ever will give a damn about her and her condition then i saw this filmbr br i knew what christys family was going through but they were lucky christy could talk he could communicate and he had artistic skills my sister can walk but she cant utter a word and she cant use her hands to do anything but grab onto things but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister and the ending to tell the truth made me cry and ive seen shawshank this film is seriously underrated and it shouldnt this movie tells people something that people should be proud of their own lives thinking you cant write well this guy wrote with his foot thinking youre not attractive this guy got turned down by lots of girls because of his condition not the fastest runner christy couldnt even stand upbr br my point parents of young children i suggest your children watch this movie with you so theyll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair they dont stare at them like theyre aliens my sister got millions of stares and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people this film will teach people that people who might not seem normal are people too 1010
