saw this film on dvd yesterday and was gobsmacked and flabbergasted the unaffected acting of ddl just blew my mind and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting all of the character were so authentic to me i really took ddl for christy burns and brenda fricker for his mom go and see it youll cry your heart out but youll experience a wonderful catharsis besides it teaches you one important lesson determination is everything you may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of dublin but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in selfpity it wont get you anywhere and the only person wholl pity you will be yourself
