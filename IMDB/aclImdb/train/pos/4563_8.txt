hard to imagine this film is based on a true story and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heartstirring daniel daylewis is a chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experiencebr br the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing christy is not despised by the normals his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyesbr br one important factor of christys success is his mothers support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role this fat little middleaged woman uses her all to make christys dream come true so lucky for christyand hugh oconor is also excellent as young christy what a performance for a child the love story of christy is very welldone trustful christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr eileen cole surprisingly played by fiona shaw i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the loathsome aunt petunia so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is paranoiac and offensive i do have sympathy for him love is a twoedged sword happiness and agony are just next to each otherbr br btw jim sheridans works are all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die trying god knows why he chose to direct that crap really a career taint for him what a pity
