daniel daylewis is christy brown a victim of cerebral palsy who uses my left foot to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film the movie also stars brenda fricker as christys mother ray mcanally fiona shaw and hugh oconor their brilliant performances great script and wonderful direction by jim sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of christy brown an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49br br brown was born into a lower middleclass catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant 22 children in total 13 of whom survived his father considered christy mentally retarded as well as physically handicapped but he would not permit his son to go into a home the children in the family would bid goodbye to him each day as they went off to school and then his mother would feed him and talk to himbr br in the movie fricker conveys the sense of a woman who despite being surrounded by a huge family needs someone to talk to christy doesnt talk back eventually a cart is found for him to ride in and the neighborhood kids all of whom have known him since he was a baby include him in all of their activities the only part of his body that works really well is his left foot and when the kids find out how well he kicks they put him into soccer games for just that purpose one of the nicest parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat himbr br there are many powerful scenes but none as powerful as christy writing mother on the floor holding a piece of chalk between his toes hes a true brown his father declares hoisting him on his shoulders and carrying him to the pub walking into the pub he announces my sons a genius things change when christy grows older because he has a young boys desires and emotions he develops crushes is rejected and goes more into himself turning to painting eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist eileen fiona shaw at home he falls in love with her when he finds out shes engaged he nearly goes crazy but he survives to live to paint to write three books in total and to love againbr br because its a film by necessity certain things had to be left out and characters combined brown wasnt actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time which was left out of the movie the therapist eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in christys life and though we know that his mother believed he had a good mind in truth she worked very hard with christy when he was a child teaching him the alphabet etc also before mary christy had a 12year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated my left foot and the typical hollywood ending 9 years before his death where neglect by his wife may have been a factor doesnt finish the storybr br despite all of that christy browns biopic is incredibly powerful all the more so because of two performances hugh oconor as young christy and daniel daylewis as the adult christy oconors facial expression and the way he drags his warped body is gutwrenching one is exhausted for him and heartbroken at the same timebr br and what can be said about daniel daylewis one of the greatest actors in the world  he brings christy totally to life a fully fleshed out intelligent human being capable of swearing becoming angry bitter drunk pushy lecherous funny and loving a welldeserved oscar won in the same year that tom cruise was nominated for born on the fourth of july i remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that cruise was so sensational what was wrong with the academy uh nothing for a change nothing at allbr br brenda fricker is amazing as christys mother who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds her family and husband together during the hard times the wonderful thing about frickers performance is that the support love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother the character would never consider herself a heroine or as someone doing something out of the ordinary fricker shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother and no matter what even when her husband is out of work throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant whatever she manages she saves money for christys wheelchair she receives photos of her daughter and the baby she starts building a room for christy in the back of the house all part of a days work a performance worthy of the oscar she receivedbr br browns life was more complicated than this inspiring film but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a mustsee
