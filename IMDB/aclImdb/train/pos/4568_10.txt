seriously can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget daniel daylewis ray mcanally brenda fricker hugh oconor and fiona shaw theres no doubting that fricker and daylewis deserved their awards but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen oconor as young christie and mcanally awarded the clich√© is true here they dont perform the roles they inhabit them daylewis performance is a tour de force  such a transformation that it is aweinducing but it was truly a mark of the academys intelligence that alongside this performance they also honoured brenda frickers beautifully restrained still and heartwrenching work as christies mother by the way if you havent seen this magnificent actress in swann thats another film well worth checking out for her contribution and the sublime miranda richardson
