daniel daylewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writerbr br the film however is a very difficult one to reviewor even watch fortunately i had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter i cant say its the sort of film id want to view more than oncebr br nevertheless my attention was held by the storytelling device a flashback framed by the present in which we see christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him who certainly gave him loving carebr br daniel daylewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist fiona shaw much to his mothers fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken theres a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too muchbr br brenda fricker does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until daylewis begins to have success with his work she complements daylewis performance as the warmhearted mother and shares many poignant moments with himbr br richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film both fricker and daylewis won oscars but hugh oconor and ray mcanally are also excellent oconor is christy as a boy and mcanally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boybr br summing up elmer bernsteins music is an added plus factor well worthwhile but definitely not a film for everyone
