the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel daylewis and hugh oconor as christy brown guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family lowincome working class dubliners encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy browns witty arrogant personality i do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movielovers
