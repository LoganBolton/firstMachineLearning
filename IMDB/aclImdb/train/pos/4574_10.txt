let me state at the outset that i have cerebral palsy and i went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance i left the theater halfconvinced that theyd cast an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role even though i knew that was not the case the performances were generally excellent with a special nod to brenda fricker and to hugh oconner i believe thats his name as the young christy brown christy is talented brash arrogant at times vulgar and petulantin other words human this film along with gaby a true story and the documentary king gimp are excellent portrayals of life with cp by no means a complete portrait but fine examples of the disabled as human beings most highly recommended
