i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of marykates and ashleys characters sam and emma stanton they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but unfortunately its just not that easy for them to actually do i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then im sure that youll agree with me here if you havent seen this movie yet then i say you really missedout big time and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now this movie is a real winner sincerely rick morris
