its depressing to see where jackie chan has ended up he used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches kicks and incredible stunts to be fair hes now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown but with rush hour 3 where he takes a back seat to chris tucker of all people and then theres kung fu panda where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue to say that jackie chan has seen better days is a colossal understatementbr br its times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some arses in his younger fitter chris tuckerfree daysbr br enter police story jackie chan plays karkui a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial he faces resistance from both the uncooperative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them bothbr br but on the other hand who cares we dont watch jackie chan films for the story we watch them to see jackie chan perform eyepopping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he isbr br and on that level police story doesnt disappoint at all there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in jackie sliding down a giant highvoltage chandelier seriously if this sort of thing happened more often no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothesbr br there is also comedy much of which involves karkui inadvertently upsetting may maggie cheung his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle but it works so im not complainingbr br the acting isnt too subtle either indeed im not sure there was anything subtle about police story at all director jackie chan yeah he does that too clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films and knows that while were waiting for the next fight to start the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaningbr br so police story is a blast as is the case with most of his films the fact that jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition i mean when jackie chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella a whole new wow factor is added to the action
