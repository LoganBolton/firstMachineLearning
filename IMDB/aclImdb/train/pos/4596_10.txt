this is jackie chans best film and my personal favourite after the disappointing us made the protector directed by james glickenhaus jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong this is also probably jackies most violent movie with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stuntsbr br the action is fast and furious jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as youll see in the creditsbr br the script is a simple cops and robbers affair nothing special after all it was written around the action i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing but it shouldnt put you off too muchbr br so get the lads round crack open the beers and enjoy by the way the film was nicknamed glass story by the stunt crew why ill let you find out for yourself
