this is the best series of its type ive seen all year i cant help thinking its just my luck  a series i love gets 6 episodes and more next year and the constant stream of cookiecutter cop shows get never ending episodesbr br i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat the stories arent all that memorable but thats not the reason i watch shows like this one br br the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it isnt available in any published edition great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sexappeal aside from the young constable nobodys there as eyelolly and even if he is he can still act
