police story is a stunning series of set pieces for jackie chan to show his unique talents and bravery some of the stunts here are among jackies best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably jackies greatest single fight sequence more brutal and less comedic then say project a or drunken master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impactbr br but unfortunately the rest of the film doesnt hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements i always prefer jc in films such as project a where his natural comic talents shine through in the serious confines of some elements of police story it just doesnt work for me having said that though this is still up there with jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectaclebr br as usual with hong kong films avoid the english dubbed dvd version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitlesbr br great stunts ok movie a fine starting point if youve not seen a jc movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 710
