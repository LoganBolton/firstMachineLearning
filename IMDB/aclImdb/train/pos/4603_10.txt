there is one detail which is not very common for jackie chan movies but which is present here it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too jackie is menacing and psychotic here he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laidback pattern but he is the one who can go and start the tumult his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing every time it goes crack i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend its one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen besides the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of rabochiy from our soviet era and some lines in russian on the left i noticed that quite accidentally that looks terrific and nostalgic for russian people i also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies here theres a lot of this stuff its quite amazing watching the characters fallingjumpingrunningdriving through all manner of panesbr br all three movies are great i had been preparing myself to see the downslide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only jackie chans character appears in all three movies  thats also excellent and keeps continuity upbr br i would like to describe each movie just in a few words no1  great in all aspects  it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous no2  raging jackie is really beep off here and painful jackie gets tortured no3  unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible and bombastic should i mention a lot of guns and explosionsbr br as to the rest  much has been mentioned by the othersbr br its a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me its place is in top 10 among actioncomedy jewels finally its been released in russia on dvd the 2nd film has the best options  the chineserussian soundtracks and englishrussian subtitlesbr br solid 10 out of 10 thank you for attention
