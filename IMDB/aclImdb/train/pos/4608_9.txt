jackie chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and police story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late great bruce lee if enter the dragon bared the socalled bench mark of lees greatness in the 70s then the same can be said about police story and jackie chan in the 80sbr br forget about the rush hour trilogy or any of his us efforts the one film that really typifies chans excellence not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking bonecrushing kung fu talisman as well as his movie career was this police story the first in a series of successful cop films set in mainland present day hong kongbr br ive seen many of his efforts likewise the usbased rush hour rumble in the bronx the medalian and the tuxedo to name and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to police story in those movies we saw a less dumbed down version of jackie of whom didnt get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as drunken master police story to name br br the stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie the shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed the flying shards of glass chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town and chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with br br considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harms way jackies persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert especially as he has the bruises to show for it thus he has proved that he is no onetrick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking movesbr br storywise there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative it makes up with its endto end action and fight sequences as for the dialogue well its not a really huge aspect of the film which is why most fans of jackies and martial arts films are more interested in action as opposed to the storybr br unlike say the matrix there are no wires or cgi or any form of computer trickery involved what you see is what you get and what you get with police story is a great jackie chan epic full of action and pulsating stuntsit is miles better than rumble in the bronx rush hour and all his other american effortsbr br police story is an excellent film and one id definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice jackie chan fan but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first
