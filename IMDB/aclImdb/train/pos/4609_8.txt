probably jackie chans best film in the 1980s and the one that put him on the map the scale of this selfdirected police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which a squatters village and shopping mall are demolished there are clearly differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter the latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals in fact the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialÂ—at the time trials in colonial hong kong were conducted in english while the original has this scene in cantonesebr br nonetheless chans fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible so noncantonese audiences dont miss much its not after all the dialogue that makes a chan flick but the action and the painful outtakes the story is easy to follow chan plays an incorruptible hong kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather cho yeun and assigned to protect a star witness brigitte lin the action is superb from beginning to end and theres not much time to breathe in between itll never get you thinking but what an entertaining and well strungtogether film arguably this is one of the best martial arts films out there
