this movie is ridiculous thats exactly what i like about this piece of guilty pleasure it is easy to condemn this movie for not including pat priest and butch patrick the original marilyn and eddie but look at the year and do the math pat priest and butch patrick had long outgrown their parts time does that to young stars yvonne de carlo who reprised her role as lili was pushing the big 60 even though she still looked good and was still the perfect lilibr br its a shame that yvonne de carlo wasnt given a larger part still it was good to see fred gwynne and al lewis in the roles that made them so famous during the 2 seasons that the munsters was on prime time it was the gwynnelewis chemistry that made the series such a success the rest of the cast were supporting cast members not to say that they werent needed they were the tv series wouldnt had survived as long as it did without them given the choice between butch patrick or happy derman the original eddie the choice was too easy yvonne de carlo was also the better choice over joan marshallbr br though this movie doesnt measure up to the original tv series it still measures up nicely and is one of the better reunuin tv specials that plagued the boobtube during the late 1970searly 1980sbr br
