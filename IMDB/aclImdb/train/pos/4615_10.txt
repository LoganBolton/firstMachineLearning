i think that people are under estimating this incredible film people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 110 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 1010 for the pure entertainment of the filmbr br the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiecethat has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining
