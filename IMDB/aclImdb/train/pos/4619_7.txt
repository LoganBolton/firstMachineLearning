first off im a huge fan of 80s movies and of jennifer conelly as well so yesterday i wandered into a local used bookmovie store and found a vhs copy i read the back and it sounded good and for 399 it was a good deal so i took it home and popped it in the vcr what a sweet movie at my age now i relate more to movies like about last night or st elmos fire but still i remember what it was like to be 1516 and in love with an older guy etc we all have those little crushes when were younger and if it doesnt work out were heartbroken and we think that well never get over it but of course we do many times its that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie the feeling of oooh i remember when something like that happened to me is all through it the characters are interesting and welldeveloped i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives
