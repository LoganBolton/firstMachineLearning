despite its rather salacious title this is a light teen dramedy unless youre an old coot youll probably find it likeable it isnt so good on developing characters or situations smoothly though when you view it you get the feeling that youve been running back and forth to the kitchen even if youve been sitting down watching the whole time this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters and they are appealing enough jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many i know but ive always liked the more obscure maddie corman the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grownups is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike
