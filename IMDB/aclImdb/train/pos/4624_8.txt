believe it or not inspector gadgets last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thingbr br my name is miriam and i am twelve years old so obviously i wasnt around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career sure id heard of him but i didnt really know himbr br while reading note that i never saw the original series i would if it came on this is just about the only gadget thing ive ever watched even though i am now obsessed and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative for all you pessimists ive got some cons down there too p first off for a childish sense of humor you could deem this movie pretty funny i thought it was so sue me i also thought the animation and character designs were good and im also happy there was more gadget in it since hes my favorite character i do not like penny then there was claw his voice was awful though and the madcat i thought they were done fairly good too gadgets idiocy seemed pretty well in place if not a bit exaggerated ie sucking his hathand things thumb would make a good screen shot though p oh and i liked the song that ran in the credits yes i am strangebr br and like all movies there are some negatives toobr br talking cars whats up with that you can tell this was aimed at younger boys that wouldnt bother me quite so much if there wasnt the fact that the cars basically saved the day i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place and apparently gadget loved his car more than would be called natural a bit weird to say the leastbr br oh and the chief was downright mean to gadget i mean sheesh yeah he wasnt always the most cheerful of people but he didnt hate gadget from what ive read like the inspector his personality was exaggeratedbr br well thats pretty much all i have to say about this movie i thought the animation made up for the carcentered plot and that it was overall pretty decent more so than the liveaction gadget films butchered butchered butchered at least maybe im just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place or maybe my mind is twisted or maybe im just odd but i really liked this movie even if im the oldest its recommended for
