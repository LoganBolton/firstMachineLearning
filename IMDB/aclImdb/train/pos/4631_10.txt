movies like this one and crazy make me very sad for american films with a gay subject matter with the exception of parting glances and brokeback mountain there are few other notable american films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie the bubble this movie centers on two men noam and ashwar an israle and palestinian respectively their relationship is complicated by the tension between the jews and arabs in israel couples in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next or who will say i love you first noam and ashwars early love is complicated by suicide bombings armed security check points and racism while noams friends accept and like ashwar who is arab it is clear that most of tel avivs citizens probably dontbr br one of the most touching moments and there are many in this film is when noam and ashwar attend a production of bent we as movie goers see them watching this play and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes and ultimately this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the moviebr br ohad knoller and youseff joe sweid are outstanding as noam and ashwar director eytan fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the shakespeare classic romeo and juliet and while most movies today have sex in them almost as a sport this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined it is so refreshing also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons there are cartoonish characters in this movie it just doesnt happen to be the two gay guys for a change somewhere on this site i think i read a comparison between this movie and friends well not really yes these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships but i dont recall getting blowed up as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in friendsbr br this is a very good movie it has heart and heartbreak and like all good love stories love does win out but not in its intact glory of full bloom  still its a very satisfying movie to watch
