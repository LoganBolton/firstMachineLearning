heres one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox the movie presents the story of starcrossed lovers one israeli one palestinianin modern tel aviv the films effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of crossethnic conflict but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well for example theres a telling moment when one of the secondary characters openly gay is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room clearly the young man is not as open as he seems and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be while the boyfriend is confused and rejected a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment as we know from yossi  jagger fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences the film is also effective for the evenhanded way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other if youre not heartless youll cry through the last third of the movie though the plot is melodramatic its so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be
