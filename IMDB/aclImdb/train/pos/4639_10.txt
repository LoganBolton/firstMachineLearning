i got this one a few weeks ago and love it its modern light but filled with true complexities of life it questions and answers just like other eytan fox movies this is my favorite along with jossi  jagger this pictures a lot more universally than only the bubbles we may live in you dont need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this  im not but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further relationships we have to live with are superficial meaningful deep fatal you name it you dont know whats coming and you definitely dont know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time it is worth seeing several times fox movies include great bonus material  here a great music video and the making of including explanation of the title interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles
