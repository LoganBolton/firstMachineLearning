its one of the best movies ive seen in the last 2 years ive seen the premier in telaviv israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesnt matter who boys and girls straight and gays jews and arabs ive seen the bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel aviv and jerusalem the last time i saw it was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel  the most symbolic i could  how ironic and he cried in the end  if hes been touched and wasnt embarrassed everyone would be touched by the bubble
