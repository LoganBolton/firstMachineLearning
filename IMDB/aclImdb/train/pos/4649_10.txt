this first installment of crispin glovers personal magnum opus asks you to think a little and so cant be recommended for any viewer who doesnt want to sit and puzzle over glovers imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative to the more casual viewer yes its probably going to come off as a confusing mishmash of odd startling and disturbing imagery for imagerys sake br br you get the sense that glover doesnt mind that this is the case and hell almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it glovers innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presentedbr br the easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as dada or nihilist a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor whos worked both without and within but theres a reason why glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie and its not only to sell books his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that glover pieced together and what is it does similarly with imagery drawn from western culture br br what is it is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing much has already been made about glovers use of actors with downs syndrome and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film so jarring in fact that many seem to interpret it as some sort of farreaching crusade to see a more realistic andor dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor on the absolute other end of the spectrum as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled but its not either and maybe thats part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness its not a film about downs syndrome but it is a film that is owned by the actors with downs syndrome who appear in itbr br im the sort of person who is entirely gungho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful happily for me this is pretty much exactly how what is it presents itself to viewers glover uses the strange images of snails death and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail in some ways the weirdly compelling and occasionally downright grotesque elements of what is it remind me of the work of the painter francis bacon he of the infamous popes yes and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away like bacons paintings glovers film manages to be opulent and humble grainy and polished chaotic and wellrealized and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting but still this is not an entirely serious film and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that for the most part derives from the use and juxtaposition of familiar items images and names of popular culture and when what is it is funny it is very funnybr br overall what is it is an impressive first film from glover as a director and writer and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that isnt exactly good or bad but just strange and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up if thats the kind of art you enjoy what is it is likely to exceed your expectations and be wellworth the effort of catching it in the theatre along with the big slide show and glover himself all in all its an experience youre unlikely to forget any time soon
