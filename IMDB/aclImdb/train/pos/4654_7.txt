its about an embezzler peter ustinov who infiltrates a british company texaconn or something like that posing as a computer whiz and security expert he secretly learns to hack into the computer while gathering the admiration of his boss karl malden the enmity of his office rival bob newhart and the love of his inept secretary maggie smithbr br some of the business details were a little murky to these nonbusinessoriented eyes but theyre believable enough and i got the general idea ustinov the peculating peter establishes phony businesses in paris rome and stuttgart and uses texaconns computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments the overseas companies of course consist of nothing more than himself ustinov and the addresses are an abandoned artists loft in paris a barber shop in rome and a bakery in germany he simply visits them to collect the checks hes sent himselfbr br i didnt think id like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side i was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage along the lines of the pink panther or the lavender hill gang but this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot the characterizations and the dialogbr br probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeablebr br ustinov to secretary smith let me have the assets of these companies smith assets what are they ustinov little female donkeys now nothing is made of this little exchange theres a quick cut and no delay for any laughter which is appropriate because ones reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laughbr br ustinov searches out that crummy loft in paris its covered with cobwebs bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupants paintings have been left behind the landlord doesnt speak english and ustinov knows no french ustinov points to a childlike painting of a nude woman and chuckles ah a fam fyetal eh landlord chuckles too replies vous le prenez pour une anee ustinov oh  annie so thats her name landlord oui ustinov entente cordiale mes amis if i got those genders wrong je mexcuse bob newhart as willard gnatpole  has the hots for maggie smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her hes taking the scenic route there is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs caution layby give way yield ending with the imperious stopchildren theres another montage when ustinovs scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors  blurry rooftops police cars a farewell embrace from maggie ending with a sign prison wormwood scrubsbr br well maybe one more i still cant get over malden as the boss declaring decisively i never agonize over decisions then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of waterbr br the acting is unarguably fine its bob newharts best role for instance not that he had that many and not that his range wasnt limited but hes perfect in this part the musical score by laurie johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it she seems to have written a brief concerto for flute ustinovs passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like claude debussy and giacconino rossini stuttgarts phony president is somebody named schmidt and hes an anomalous clinker maggi smith is pretty sexy bourgeois and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seemsbr br delightful in its own quiet way but dont expect comic fireworks
