a clever undeniably entertaining romp starring peter ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a us conglomerate in london hes abetted by foxy and deceptively sharp maggie smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man bob newhart this is a heist film with a lot of brains ustinov is exceptional as is smith and newhart is quite funny the real surprise is karl malden as the pill popping executive vicepresident malden has seldom been so loose cesar romero and robert morley pop up in some funny cameos the excellent music score is by laurie johnson eric tills direction is brisk and the script by ustinov and ira wallach is firstrate  very smart a swinging good time
