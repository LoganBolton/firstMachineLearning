hot millions is a wellwritten wellacted tale about an embezzler who steals whoops  too low class a word for an embezzler according to peter ustinovs lead character a hot million from the london branch of a us corporation by creating shell corporations on the continent and using the firms ostensibly secure computer to transfer funds to them remember spoiler police this is a comedy not a mystery br br from 1968 this movies depiction of computers may seem naive to todays more computerliterate populace but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released i would assert that even then this smacks of having been written by and for computer illiterates probably on purpose to heighten the droll comedic aspects of this british flick br br if one has little taste for this type of entertainment the movie may seem to drag in spots fortunately it has a nicely wrappedup ending unfortunately the end credits give no indication of the classical music used therein  the symphonic piece at the end and the pianoflute duet in the middle  just the song sung by lulu which i totally dont remember
