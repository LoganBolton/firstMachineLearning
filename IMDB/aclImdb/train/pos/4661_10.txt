i can only echo the praise of the other reviews here its a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality naturally sweet  no added sugarbr br one small point it seems to me that the mild objections raised about ustinovs character pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that pendelton is clearly a geniussavant at this sort of thing yes the film was pretty computer illiterate but it did show pendelton studying computers at his flat and i believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject practically overnightbr br there were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that gnatpole was trying to test pendeltons knowledge and call his bluff im not sure whether we were supposed to believe that pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests  it was a little unclearbr br certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts presumably wallach and ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at its necessary to know quite what their concept was they knew there was something about procedures which was important they thought that the smart light could actually control security rather than just indicate its state they thought that the dumb user terminals features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself  though apart from things like graphics feature i dont see it meselfbr br mostly i think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could and they did that rather well allowing them a bit of artistic license i dont think their efforts had any flaws worthy of notebr br cd
