if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 i dont know who they were i first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one its intelligent quirky neat wistful sweet gently subversive and utterly enchanting the romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving  never more so than in maggie smiths desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck a scene thats both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness and that final freezeframe on the anxious concerned loving face of ustinov as he asks are you all right  has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest i would never want to know anyone well who didnt love this movie
