this was an exteremely good historical drama john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the characters manic affectations such as his strange dancing emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover nataliabr br the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as eternal innocence ie lolita are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie
