those who only remember the late sir peter ustinov as hercule poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late 60s satire ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governors tax return who sensing that the future is in computers poses by means of a deft piece of identity theft as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an american multinationalbr br ustinov who cowrote the script is on top form as is the delightful maggie smith here unusually cast as an accidentprone cockneysparrow dolly bird bob newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on maggie smith in addition karl malden is satisfyingly sleazy as ustinov and newharts womanising bossbr br what do i particularly like about this film not only is it a wellthoughtout caper movie but its also a touching little love story ustinov and smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effectivebr br so what is there not to like well the script is no more computerliterate than most films that is hardly at all even though it captures the feel of late 60s big iron business computing quite well also there are a couple of small plot glitches that youre not likely to notice until the second or third viewing but i consider these to be minor nigglesbr br as i said this is a film which is well worth seeking out and after youve seen it once youll want to see it again at regular intervalsbr br
