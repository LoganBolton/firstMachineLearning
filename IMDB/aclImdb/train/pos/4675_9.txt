i saw brothers shadow at the tribeca film festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later the story of a prodigal son scott cohen returning to his familys custom furniture business after a stint in jail it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid dramamemorable characters sharp observant dialog sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visuallybr br but more than that it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility the talent of directorscreenwriter todd s yellin seems to emerge fullblown but we get the sense he like his protagonist has paid his dues he knows how real people struggle in this world and he knows how we yearn to seeor at least to experience vicariouslysuccess yet yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends in the end we see that jakes triumph doesnt lie in commissions or even in the esteem of his family but in the work he couldnt abandon if he triedbr br its an essential theme in a world and especially a movie industry that cant rise above the bottom line this film deserves a wide audience
