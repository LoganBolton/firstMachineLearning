i found this movie thoughtprovoking and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quickfix films where we are manipulated into loving the good guy and hating the bad guy scott cohen a very handsome television actor does a great job of portraying the family black sheeplost child who aspires to gain his fathers love and respect as well as that of his widowed sisterinlaw with whom he apparently has a history judd hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejectedbr br when i saw this at the tribeca film festival i was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition as explained by the directorbr br this is a fitting successor to the classic ordinary people i just realized judd hirsch was in that too
