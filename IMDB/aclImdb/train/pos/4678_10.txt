i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a firsttime productionbr br one interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city brooklyn in specific the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life Â– again kudos to the director on this fine choicebr br this is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it im sure it will make it to the screen
