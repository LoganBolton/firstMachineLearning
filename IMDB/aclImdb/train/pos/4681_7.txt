overall i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film loversbr br however i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and nichols closer one scene especially where adrian greniers character is questioning rosario dawsons about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive owens character is questioning julia roberts although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in love also note that anna is the name of both dawsons and roberts character cant be coincidence now closer is based on patrick marbers play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur schnitzlers reigen so im not sure how this connection formedbr br anyone have an idea
