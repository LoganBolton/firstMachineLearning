i agree wholeheartedly with the comments so far i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative ive ever seen as stated before i recall that i began watching thinking it was just another nature study  interesting not necessarily special but i was so wrong not only was the story of the colony incredible but i remember the music as being so much a part of its appeal if i remember correctly it was native americn pipes akin to the music at the end of one flew over the cookoos nest i too have been looking for a copy this should be required watching for anybody but especially the schools it should be rereleased
