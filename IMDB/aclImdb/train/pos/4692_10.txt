although critically maligned johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen its a movie that should be watched closely some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them for instance keep an eye on michael keatons use of the pricing gun at the pet storeand also on the documentarystyle years that appear at the beginning of scenes its one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly even though you know its a comedy amy heckerling the director is really sharp hereif you enjoyed her better known films fast times at ridgemont high clueless european vacation etcyou should give this one a lookbr br michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast griffin dunne maureen stapleton joe piscopo peter boyle is excellent highly recommended
