johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with its overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense but thats the point rightbr br the cast is likable michael keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed griffin dunne peter boyle joe piscopo marilu henner and danny devito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me but the complete scene stealer here is richard dimitri sneaking the word iceholes into movie history as a mobster who fares best at murdering the english languagebr br i associate many childhood memories with this film as i watched it quite often so maybe im prone to enjoy it more than many others johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking and sexbr br i like it but its hard to recommendbr br 7 out of 10
