okay  ill confess this is the movie that made me love what michael keaton could do he does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of james cagney with charm to sparebr br the supporting cast are solid workers all and will step right up and do a fine job in this 80s comedy a spoof of the 30s40s gangster movies it breaks new ground constantly with remarkably original material well yeah  some of it has been copied since  but when this movie was made it was original and much of it has not been copied elsewhere watch joe piscopo warn people to not do  with one of the great taglines of spoofs watch roman moronie do things with english profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh watch amazing sight gags such as petstore owner johnny kelly using the pricetag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens watch the greatest warning against sex educational film ever made watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church latin done while a guy who never took shop class assembles a thompson machine gun from parts watch lines youll be using in casual conversation for the next decade watch maureen stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hardworking mom with surprise gags that youll never see comingbr br if you see a gag that doesnt hit your funny bone be patient  another will come along in 30 seconds or less and the odds are youll need to pause until youre done rolling on the floor several times duckies and bunnies them too watch for the subtle stuff  some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewingsbr br there are a few minor flaws  but its probably the best of the spoofs some come close but none of them are quite this good
