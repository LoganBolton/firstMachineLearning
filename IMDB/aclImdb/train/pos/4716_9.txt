this movie is just too funny a totally nonpc gangster romp if mel brooks made a picture about the mob in the 30s it would probably look like this too many great oneliners to to remember and while its not for everyone anyone who doesnt laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse so put it on and laugh you iceholes
