how can anyone not love this movie  i think its a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies if youve never seen them watch this instead michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless da but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo he has all the best lines danny devito alan hale ray walston are in this starstudded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than mafia did for the criminal underground
