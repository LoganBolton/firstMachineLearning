trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is soon to closebr br we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts to avoid the possibility of avalanches somehow that doesnt make sense anyways hes about to blow away one particularly big one when he notices the resort is open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is overbr br soon as everyone expects an avalanche hitsbr br look im not gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a bmovie designed for the family channel which i just saw it on and the fact it had no commercials proves its a bmovie anyways its a pretty decent film but its partially unrealbr br firsthand when people are buried by ice and snow theyre buried not just traced by powder or what about a cd for a screwdriver its not possible and finally what i cant stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche guaranteedbr br furthermore its worth a rental or a tv viewing but not owning 710br br the movie is rated pg but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the ankle a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel and in the weight room dead people are laying aroundbr br enjoy
