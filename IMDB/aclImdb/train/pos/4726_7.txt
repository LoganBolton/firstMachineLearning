this movies origins are a mystery to me as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it i assume that before starship troopers killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema the quick cuts cheesy melrose place music and short 2second closeup candid shots of the main actors let you know what youre in forbr br and i dont mind at all i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie  but thats another review after looking it up on imdb my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bondgirl and wild things references here they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted rrated status  coveted in suspense video rental sections that is in any event they should have left it unrated if youre trying to sell it in the suspensesoftcore porn sectionbr br all in all its entertaining i hate to spoil the fun of telling you its a tv pilot though that was the biggest pull while watching it  when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usualbr br would i rent it again no would i watch this tv show well why not  its better than baywatch and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s token black guy whos gay to avoid the tv taboo of interracial dating token asian japanese i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent latina premed student who has everything going for her except her familys bank account  this show probably would have done okbr br but as a movie it just cracks mebr br i gave it a 7 out of 10 considering what it was and what it was forced to become it made for a very enjoyable evening and thats all i ask of rentals
