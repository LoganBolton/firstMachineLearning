i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie witty writing some inside jokes i got others i didnt  maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another great acting notably john cassini great cameos interesting and unique directing i rented it to see jeffrey meek very disappointed he was in it such a short time blink and youll miss him but found the movie remarkably entertaining ill actually watch it again before i send back to netflix i think actors and wannabe actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie the ending is somewhat expected but wish theyd done something different and more positive too bad the movie wasnt better received except for in the festival market i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz
