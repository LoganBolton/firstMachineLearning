after seeing break a leg in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable filmbr br i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos eric roberts in particular were a scream i havent heard word about actual release date although ive heard its closebr br the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations the script is smooth and seamless the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals its been in which is around 10  15 or sobr br i highly recommend break a leg
