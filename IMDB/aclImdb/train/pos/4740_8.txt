ok its not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that its really really bad i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the 1990s and loved the era dearly i never saw black mask at the time and only saw it last week for the first time apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didnt give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated hong kong movies during this time i still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy casino royale or mission impossible im not knocking these movies  i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated will ever achieve what is it its the feeling that the filmmakers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time for me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous
