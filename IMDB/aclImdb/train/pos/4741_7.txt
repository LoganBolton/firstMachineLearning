what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the us cut was so bad although you could detect the underlying goodwill in itbr br talking about the us theatrical releasealong with the newly released bluray disc version its faster and tighter than hk cut the background musics were all changed from the dark grim hk musics to hiphop musics and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actors voice and tone but the problem is hak hapblack mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim superdisturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the us release just skimmed the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movies undertonehk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurishbr br now lets talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit oldschool among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batmanlike superhero in a black mask against a runofthemill gang of multinational supersoldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works its so impressive that the whole movies gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg13 rating but without jet li and liu qing yun and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention francois yip her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didnt use a stuntman for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the moviebr br however the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off its a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screenwriter there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like farfetched and dont totally make senses to the audiencesus version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you cant ask too much out of a comicinspired action movie also this movie is entirely improper for children i wont recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old its saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sadomaso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavymetal rock music fans and action fans the us cut was milder but if you want to see it see the hk release for what it is 710 status inspiring hidden undervalued adult
