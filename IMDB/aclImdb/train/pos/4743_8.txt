this is a very strange hk film in many ways first many of the action sequences really arent that much fun the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly not cool silly or even funny silly but just silly thats not to say there arent some great action scenes but most simply dont come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen the opposite side is that this film actually has characters not just people all of the main characters are interesting except for the head bad guy who is flat as a billiard table and most are fairly well acted all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch the dialogue is quite witty and doesnt seem to lose much in translation this film is worth seeing but i hope that uninitiated american audiences dont think this is the best hk has to offer
