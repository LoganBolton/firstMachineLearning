this film appears to draw a borderline  on one side those who love it on the other those who find it unbearablebr br to begin with there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not getting of course jet lis mask looks like bruce lees kato  hes supposed to its a joke the guy who has a timebomb sewn to his heart  outrageous of course its a joke some readers will probably ask if this film is supposed to be so funny why all the excessive and gory violence well for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different from culture to culture and while hong kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme its certainly only slightly more than average for a hk action filmbr br also black mask is really the kind of film that takes a genres conventions and pushes them to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic after decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds many people were horrified to see bonnie and clyde and the outlaws of the wild bunch spurting blood all over the place but the fact is when youre shot with rapid metal projectile its almost certain that blood will spurt especially from an arterybr br this film is a chinese comic book movie it is true that the spiderman films never get this gory  but if they were faithful to reality they would be well despite its comicbook origins this film is faithful to realitybr br the only complaint i have is the flashy overstylized filming and editing if the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to hollywoodstyle nostalgia as eg the rocketeer or the recent sky captain film i doubt anyone would have found it offensivebr br but as it stands i still had a lotta fun watching this movie
