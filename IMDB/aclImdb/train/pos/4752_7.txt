a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth things must be pretty bad back on mars two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracys pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby dinerbr br the diner has had no customers since eleven oclock that morning now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didnt notice who they were the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed one of them is an alien but which one all of them are suspect theres the crazy old man jack elam of course who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit theres a blustering businessman who must get to boston john hoyt a young couple on their honeymoon execrable performance by the husband ron kipling except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else and even the couples are suspicious of each other bride to newly minted husband i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way  the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the juke box turns itself on  and none of it is to be taken seriouslybr br its a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle there is no discernible depth to it its not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens its not a warning of any kind just a fairy tale that diverts and amusesbr br i always enjoy it when its on its especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgms version of shakespeares play and here he is  with three armsbr br oops
