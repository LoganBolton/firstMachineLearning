in a series chockfull of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites its not the most profound episode theres no great meaning or message but its a lot of fun and there are some fine performancesbr br but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the only twilight zone episode with a double snapper ending the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story but this time you get a surprise and think thats that but it turns out theres another surprise waiting i just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes the other being a deeper more messageoriented one
