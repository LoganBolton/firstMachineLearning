an excellent film with great performances from zack  lochley much to their displeasure  mine garibaldi arrived on station all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4  5 i lost sympathy for the character it doesnt take him long to start criticizing zack who i love best of all on the showand taking charge im sure zack could have coped the soulhunter plot is fascinating especially if you believe in heaven as zack does the humour supplements it nicely 1010
