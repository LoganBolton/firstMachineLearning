i thought the river of souls was a very good babylon 5 movie with some exceptional performances from martin sheen tracy scoggins and ian macshane if this were an episode of the series without the humour it would probably be one of my favourite standalone stories of the seriesbr br personally ive always preferred scoggins to christian although granted jms didnt write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byrontelepath plot if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all
