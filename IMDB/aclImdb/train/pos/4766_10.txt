it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest if any without his presencebr br despite a not outstanding direction  in fact there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly  a seemingly low budget a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible endbr br i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance even paul scofield acting in a man for all seasonsbr br actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crimebr br je suis maurice morand prètre catholique i am maurice morand a catholic priestis said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that endbr br the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand  who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest  consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christ´s bloodbr br gérard  the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself  has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vinebr br in next scene the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable do you carry away men too asks morand who hates himself for what he has just done that would be too much work is the smart answerbr br the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the timebr br i think that le défroqué is a very strange film but has to be seen by all viewers  if the are good catholiques it is mandatory  because it is a very rare jewell in film historybr br
