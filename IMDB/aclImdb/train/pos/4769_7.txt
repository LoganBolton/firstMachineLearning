im sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii with the cast the location style of the directing and its publicity  shows women walking around on the beach and all that no wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch itbr br it was wrong of them to do that cause after i decide to watch the show there are actually more thing going on real juicy story and conflict turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much  addictivebr br the story of the hotel clerks the manager the owner and their complicated love life also enter the troublesome hotels visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel it actually more exciting than it sounds herebr br i wont deny that the acting suck but it aint that bad that youll look away the story is not so consistence but good enough the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patiencebr br recommendation i really do enjoy watching this zillion times better than expectedbr br rating 7510 grade bbr br please rate my review after reading it thanks
