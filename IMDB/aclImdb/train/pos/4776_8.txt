i was watching this movie at one of my usual time which is real real late at night usually if a movie doesnt interest me i start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awakebr br at first i thought thats what i had to do since this movies pacing started off slow along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time but after a bit i start getting more into the movie as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling by the end you feel like youve known him your whole life the movie kept my interest so much that i didnt even know the sun was about to risebr br not much of lynchs bizzare style but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing
