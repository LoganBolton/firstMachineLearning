on paper this movie would sound incredibly boring the idea of a 75yearold man traveling the countryside on a riding mower certainly doesnt have much appeal to it but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than the straight storybr br the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl shes pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out alvin tells her a story about his own kids long ago he had them each take a stick and break it which they could easily do then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them that bundle he said is family so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger the straight story realizes that were smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusionsbr br alvins journey across iowa is full of such refreshingly unhollywood character interactions each interaction is full of warmth and humor and alvin is so cute riding his mower that we cant help but smile as he makes his way to wisconsin to make peace with his brother lyle who has suffered a stroke and the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey its a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meetsto their benefit and ours its a slow simple relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that weve lost with the urbanization of americabr br the straight story is the rare liveaction grated movie that truly should not be missed grade a
