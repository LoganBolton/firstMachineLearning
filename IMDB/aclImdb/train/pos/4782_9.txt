well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no supernatural stuff no violence no profanity nevertheless it is a beautiful flick its a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because its the story of an old mans 6weekthats my best guess for its duration journey the characters are everyday people and thus they are believable the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching everyone who has a sibling can relate to it lyle and alvin dont even have to say anything for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten
