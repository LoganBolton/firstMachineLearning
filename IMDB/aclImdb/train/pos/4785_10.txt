no spoilersbr br being a david lynch film one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do but it is a very straight story as the title might hint dont except to be caught in the usual lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing ie lost highway it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect its innovative because it so not lynch but maybe that is lynch he likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from lynch himself being a very avantgarde director he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesnt give it to them that would be craftybr br the pace of the film is slow i would almost say lawn mower speed dont expect an action orgy but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film look carefully for those small details that lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life and listen to badalamentis score and the main theme that really animates the iowa and wisconsin landscapes shown frequently br br farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film making him one of the most likeable ol men ever depicted on film he doesnt have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts his cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an oscar nomination need i say that his weak health in this film wasnt acted he was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete that knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to farnsworth br br all of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done one could ask for homilies that arent that obvious and a bit naive but it doesnt ruin the overall picture being that it is a memorable motion picture 910
