david lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way they are interesting to look at and think about but they really dont gel in your mind perhaps art will always mean the most to its creatorbr br the straight story is not a typical david lynch film not that theres anything typical about them anyway its an odyssey through rural america a real life journey alvin straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house he rode 300 miles from laurens iowa to mt zion wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offensesbr br at the heart of this film is sweet voiced richard farnsworth he brings alvin straight right to us in a simple and honest way the fact that the film is slow paced matches alvins slow journey toward realizationbr br along the way alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl she is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation after listening to alvin speak about family she reconsidersbr br later alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car she complains that she has killed several and leaves alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that nightbr br later alvins lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him a nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed they even let him call his sweet but slow daughter nicely played by sissy spacek whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past alvin insists on paying for the call the man even offers to drive alvin to his brothers with pleasure alvin declines with thanksbr br while alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted himbr br alvin also encounters two bickering brothers whove repaired his lawn mower he talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs he even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brotherbr br the night before alvin leaves the mans yard he takes his hat off to him the man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks alvin to write to him this scene is perfect in its simplicity its heartfelt because its so straight so realbr br the journey continues and we cant help to get more and more involved with it we want alvin to get to his brothers we want him to make amends we want to know this world is full of forgivenessbr br this was richard farnsworth at his best it was his last film and his performance was amazing you cant help but to understand his pride to listen to his wisdom and to ultimately feel his pain one becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay inbr br if theres justice in the afterlife then alvin straight his brother and richard farnsworth are together sitting at a bar i can picture them discussing their lives regrets hopes and joys as alvin says in the film my brother and i used to look up at the stars well i know they all are with the best view in the house
