who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother could possibly be good cinema i certainly didnt i thought i knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life well i was as wrong as i havent been wrong too often yet because this is one of the best most realistic and honest hollywood films ive ever seenbr br giving a short resume of the straight story isnt very difficult its about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke thats already special on itself but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasnt seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before its too latebr br i can easily understand why there are people who dont like this movie and thats also the reason why i will not say that these people dont have a heart or things like that this movie hasnt got any flashy action scenes it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no you dont have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either because there isnt any but why should you watch it then well the simple answer is the story i havent seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and  to make things even better  from the disney studios thats right the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special im not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for mebr br some people will argue that the story is very shallow but i really dont agree with that perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and dont want to think any further if you look close enough than youll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too so they wont make the same mistake if that isnt deep enough how much deeper does a story have to go for you then br br i would also like to add that this movie really had it all some beautiful landscapes finally an american movie that shows something else than the skyline of new york chicago or some other big city some very fine acting by richard farnsworth sissy spacek and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldnt be to my taste its one of the very best movies ive seen in a long time this movie aimed for my heart and hit the bulls eye i give it the full 1010
