a truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love describes this odd david lynch film this was especially odd because it wasnt the kind of film lynch had been putting out in the last 15 20 years those were dark and shocking films blue velvet wild at heart mulholland drive and this is the opposite i know it disappointed a lot of his fans others were delighted by it count me as one of the latter and i own all three of those dark films toobr br this was another supposedtrue life story here detailing an elderly mans trip in a seated lawnmower from western iowa all the way to wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasnt talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies well i guess that premise  an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles  still makes this an odd film of sorts so lynch stays in character with that br br richard farnsworth plays the title role he is the type of guy facewise voicewise lowkey personalitywise that just about everyone likes the wrinkles on his face tell many a story it was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was releasedbr br the first 25 minutes of this film isnt much and not always pleasant as it shows the main characters adult and mentallychallenged child sissy spacek and her tragic past but once alvin straight farnsworth begins his trip the story picks up i played this for several friends and they thought the film never picked up but i am more generous with it i think its a hidden gem to them it was a sleeping pillbr br i found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is not going to be a suspenseful lynch crime story it is slow and if thats okay with you you might like this charm enters the picture in some of people alvin meets along the way such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble henry cada as daniel riordan is a standout in that regard harry dean stanton gets third billing but thats a joke hes only in the final few minutes of the moviebr br the iowa scenery is pleasant i lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil its a nice state with nice peoplelike this movie
