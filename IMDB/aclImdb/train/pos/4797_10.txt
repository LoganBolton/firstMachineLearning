i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that hes become known for in the past decade as much as the film is grated its pure lynch in style pacing and tone the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and powerbr br the cinematography is terrific as is to be expected from a lynch film and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking its also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either good or evilbr br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial rolebr br with this film david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80s with blue velvet and the elephant man critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as twin peaks fire walk with me and lost highway but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film mulholland drive considering the high praise its received and the oscar nomination for lynchbr br straight story is to me one of the most moving motion pictures ive ever seen its a loving story about family friendship and the kindness of strangers i would highly recommend it
