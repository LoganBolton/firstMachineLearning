perhaps more than many films this one is not for everyone for some folks the idea of slowing down reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell for others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists some part they long for contact withbr br i suppose its a function of where i am in my own life these days but i count myself in the camp of the latter group i found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological this is indeed a journey story a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our daysbr br much as been written of mr farnsworths presentation of alvin straight though im not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish i had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure i hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people not just for acting but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honestybr br given the realities of production economics im not sure full credit has been given mr lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly an outsider to film production i nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression time is money is so accurately descriptive going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed and to his credit mr lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a storyhe was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality no simple task thatbr br if youd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with the straight story and then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night
