emily watsons natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century italys lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wastedbr br so many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you cant possibly capture all the poetry within a 64square yet multidimensional framework in one setting br br i did not read nabakovs book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie barry levinsons the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamuds fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and lifes conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit br br pure love as personified by emily watsons natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itbr br this is a magnificent movie 1010
