i went into the straight story expecting a sadhappy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasnt expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human conditionbr br if you didnt notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the terrain hes driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife in which he achieves the desired reunionbr br i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention
