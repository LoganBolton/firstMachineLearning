when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess2008 but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldnt just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shotbr br the only thing that really let me down are the performances emily bluntthe devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettablebr br to me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i dont know but thats how i feel about the moviebr br but overall its a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt
