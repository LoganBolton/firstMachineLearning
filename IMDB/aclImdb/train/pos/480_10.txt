the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game so many people have seen this film and just dont get it and i dont understand why while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the moviebr br  possible spoilers  be forewarnedbr br his is a life of large moves versus small moves he chooses natalia to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy listen closely to that descriptionbr br when someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves the flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well its stunningbr br various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to whos side they are on even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on beautifully donebr br i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the endbr br this film is constantly working on many levels which is why i endorse it it was a treat and a joy to watchbr br if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as piecesbr br
