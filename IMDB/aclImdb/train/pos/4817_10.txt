the young victoria is a beautiful film and has presented queen victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her the films wipes away the i am not amused impression of queen victoria and shows she was a cheerful young womanbr br as i love history particularly victorian history you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas i was a little worried that it wouldnt be historically accurate but it was and i loved it i found out new facts about queen victoria that didnt know before and it interested me greatlybr br queen victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest monarchs and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like she was treated so badly by her mothers adviser sir john conroy because he wanted britain to have a regency this was what inspired victoria to be a fantastic queen which she was the romance between her and albert was so deep and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend who were both brilliant the young victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british historyi love it 1010  no doubt
