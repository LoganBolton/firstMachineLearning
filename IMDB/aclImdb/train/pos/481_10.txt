this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because gorris takes nabokovs initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokovs onebr br the only thing in the movie which i dont like is the influence of valentinovs on luzhins destiny i cant imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novels argument
