having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs having others taste your food before you eat it facing an overbearing mother these are only a few of the obstacles which the young victoria has to deal with in this film theres also the various power struggles going on as well as attempts on her life needless to say it makes for very fascinating and informative viewingbr br i had only previously seen emily blunt in the devil wears prada and little else as she was in that film she is once again the standout here i was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young victoria and thought she handled the role very well she makes the transition from the young victoria we meet at the start of the film to the queen victoria she becomes later entirely believable blunt is perfectly cast in the role showing all the different sides from the vulnerable to the strong from the young victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control not enough can be said about emily blunt in this role shes  quite simply  exquisite commanding your attention every second shes on screen she keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the filmbr br rupert friend proves to also be wellcast as victorias love interest and eventual husband prince albert the actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship they have their disagreements but you can tell that they are in love blunt and friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between victoria and albert the other actors in the film are also very good paul bettany as lord melbourne miranda richardson as the duchess of kent mark strong as sir john conroy and jim broadbent as king william there is not a single bad performance in this film the lessfocusedupon people are wellportrayed also given what little screen time they have even victorias dog a cavalier king charles spaniel named dash is memorable and makes an impact in the filmbr br although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of victorias life  especially at the end  and instead tells us what happened with her and albert on screen what matters the most is what we actually see this is after all a film about the young victoria not the middleaged victoria nor the old victoria while there are some embellishments made on history with this film it remains focused on what it sets out to do  which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to powerbr br the movie looks amazing the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never detracts from it its exceptionally shot and unlike a lot of films these days this movie is actually a good length as it doesnt run on so long that you lose interest or feel that its needlessly being drawn outbr br it goes without saying that what makes this film so great is emily blunt shes in fine form here turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been had another actress been cast in this rather importanthistoric role this is one finelycrafted film with excellent performances that should definitely be seen if you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history this is a mustsee
