it is a tricky thing to play a queen on the one hand the actress has to be majestic and imperious and on the other she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line br br emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria but its not as full a performance as id like no blame to her i cant help but feel like this is a mills  boon novel adaptation compared to a darker more dramatic movie about another young queen elizabeth hence blunt doesnt get to run the gamut of queenly emotions at least not to the full extent since shes yknow the young victoria to see the old victoria check out mrs brownbr br jeanmarc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie he last did crazy which was excellent and propelled him to fame it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and thats probably the main similarity between the two movies but while vallee wrote crazy this one was by julian fellowes and though i really enjoyed his gosford park the story for this movie was much less interesting i soon got lost with all the governmental politics maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy im just saying
