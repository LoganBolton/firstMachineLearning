the cinematic interests in the british monarchy continues with the young victoria 1837 to 1901 after having seen in recent years the efforts with keira knightleys the duchess cate blanchetts elizabeth films and scarlett johansson and natalie portmans take on the boleyn sisters with the other boleyn girl more contemporary stories would include helen mirrens award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess dianas deathbr br each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ok so some may dispute johansson or were the flavour of their moment and each film had a definitive moment in their historical characters legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films however the young victoria as the title already suggests is a liteversion of the young queens life and if youre looking for that definitive event or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady selfserving politicians unfortunately theres nothing of depth herebr br thats not to say the young victoria is without directed by canadian jeanmarc vallee best known for crazy and written by julian fellowes this film chronicles in very plain terms the life and times of victoria emily blunt soon becoming the new it girl when she was a child the troubles she faced before coronation such as the eagerness of her mom the duchess of kent miranda richardson and her adviser sir john conroy mark strong to appoint themselves as jointregent to her throne as already planned for by reigning king william jim broadbent as if that wasnt enough the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne paul bettany being a prime ministerinwaiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace on one hand youd understand the need for a young and new queen to have trusted people in key positions but on the other are they really acting in her interests or in the interests of othersbr br even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert rupert friend where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film and pretty much everything already included in the trailers for both theyve been brought up under the influence of others and told each step of the way exactly what to do even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding and to do so with the help of each other instead of being pawns theres this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling and at times absurd rules and regulations trust also becomes a much valued commodity and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate cleanbr br however all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative from childhood to romance marriage and children in fact theres so much fastforwarding here especially the last few minutes filled with intertitles that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more and room of course for another movie which i suspect would probably not see the light of day but perhaps a television series might pick up on the films response and come out with a miniseries or such its a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes sets and art direction would be confined to a film thats quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues that they dont really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of characterdefining adversarybr br with its starstudded cast one would expect more but one would be left wanting more instead recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british monarchy only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned
