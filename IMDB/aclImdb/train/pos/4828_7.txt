rupert friend gives a performance as prince albert that lifts the young victoria to unexpected levels he is superb as we know queen victoria fell into a dark deep depression after prince alberts death and looking into ruper friends eyes i understood the film doesnt take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life an act of love i believed it or i should say him i believed what he felt was real nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of friends characterization emily blunt is good but i didnt believe for a minute she was victoria no real sense of period it may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown
