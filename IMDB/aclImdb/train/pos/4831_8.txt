i went into this expecting not to like it i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest and rather plodding and dullbr br its actually far better than that and i found myself really enjoying it i dont know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know  married to albert who died young and she mourned him ever after seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating in fact i found myself wishing id seen more of the story and i imagine we may see a sequel at some pointbr br visually the film is stunning the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top the acting is top notch from everybody involvedbr br in a word it was great
