this movie reminded me that some old black  white movies are definitely worth the lookbr br initially i had some reservations however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated i was very impressed with the mixture of drama suspense  comedybr br arthur askey tommy gander is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole timebr br definitely add this movie to your movienight for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or overly funny movies of today
