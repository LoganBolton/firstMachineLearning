as a matter of fact this is one of those movies you would have to give 75 to the fact is as already stated its a great deal of fun wonderfully atmospheric askey does indeed come across as over the top but its a great vehicle for him just as oh mr porter is for will hay if you like old dark house movies and trains then this is definitely for youbr br strangely enough its the kind of film that youll want to see again and again its friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare the odd band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical british wartime movie it would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by ealing studios  a real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact
