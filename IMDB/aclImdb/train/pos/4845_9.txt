hello playmatesi recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey i have to admit i was very impressed by this film as a fan of black and white films generally passport to pimlico the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder who is apparently a distant relative this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askeys performance however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films nowif you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of itshame these films generally arent shown on sunday afternoons anymorei am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley private godfrey in dads armyi thank you
