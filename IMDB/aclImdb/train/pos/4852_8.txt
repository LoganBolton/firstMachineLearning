now this is one of bigs best jack hulberts single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey  murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all theyre worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdochbr br the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between sidesplitting and ghastly dull when the formula works its very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists  thank any god britain hasnt got any nowadaysbr br ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers youll probably be very disappointed
