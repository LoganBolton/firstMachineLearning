this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaireginger rogers filmthe plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is thereexcept for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a repairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are usedprobably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but its very brief and with a distant camera shotbr br and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracies idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and fulllength films however in this film i must admit that they were greatnot only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this departmentbr br now as for the rest of the film its all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movienot just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasnt a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boygirl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupidall because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequenceit is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bitit had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a pointbringing my score for this film to 7
