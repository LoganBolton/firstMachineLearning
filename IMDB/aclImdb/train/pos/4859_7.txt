i read that jessie matthews was approached and turned down costarring with fred astaire in damsel in distress jessie matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any american musical films if they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime eventbr br its a pity because damsel in distress has everything else going for it fred astaire story and adapted to screen by author pg wodehouse burnsallen for comedy and songs by the gershwin brothers in answer to the question posed by the nice work if you can get it there isnt much you could ask more for this filmbr br except a leading lady though ginger rogers made several films away from fred astaire damsel in distress is the only film astaire made without rogers while they were a team young joan fontaine was cast in this opposite astairebr br her character has none of the bite that ginger rogerss parts do in these films all she basically has to do is act sweet and demure she also doesnt contribute anything musically and if i had to rate all the dancing partners of fred astaire joan fontaine would come out at the bottom the poor woman is just horrible in the things are looking up number br br when she costarred later on in a musical with bing crosby the emperor waltz its no accident that fontaine is given nothing musical to dobr br the version i have is a colorized one and in this case i think it actually did some good the idyllic lush green english countryside of pg wodehouse is really brought out in this vhs copy especially in that number i mentioned before with astaire and fontaine which does take place in the gardenbr br burnsallen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement astaire in grand style in the stiff upper lip number the surreal funhouse sequence is marvelously stagedbr br pg wodehouses aristocracy runs the gamut with constance collier at her haughty best and for once montagu love as fontaines father as a nice man on filmbr br the biggest hit out of a damsel in distress is a foggy day maybe the best known song about the british capital city since london bridge is falling down done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire its one of those songs that will endure as long as london endures and even afterbr br overlooking the young and inexperienced joan fontaine a damsel in distress rates as a classic classic score classic dancing classic comedy who could ask for anything more
