back when musicals werent showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this onebr br being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood but close enough some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with wodehouses british sense of humour but on the whole the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricaturesbr br some inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number they seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realisticbr br the lack of ginger rogers and eric blore dont hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge its also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with wodehouses young aristocratic females
