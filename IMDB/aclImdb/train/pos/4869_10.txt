not for people without swift mind or without a drop of balkan blood in their veins if you dont have any of these you can not understand it and if you dont understand you cant enjoy it  for example if you think picasso is a name of a car produced by citroen probably if you see a picassos painting you just will walk by it deciding that its a trashwork of some street painter  so do not judge before trying to understand it  in the end i think its a must for every one with open minds still my n1 remains the shawshank redemption and remember that not all things can be put in frames because there are things in this world that any frame just wont fit
