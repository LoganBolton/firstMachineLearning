before zavet there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision they find their own poetic style and then they cowardly become prisoners of it burton has and still have depp kusturica has miki manojlovic and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again however there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time thats main reason why kusturicas worst movies are black cat white cat and life is miracle zavet is something completely different you may like it you may hate it but this is not just another kusturica poetic  balkanic dreamlike stuff of course if you want to be praised you have to play safe it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award fortunately as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works zavet can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest like bergman or kubrick didnt have this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd so absurd that becomes deep and so unfunny that becomes hilarious same stuff that make plan 9 from outer space cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it average western viewer would not get few references most notable tire shop owner is srbljanovic  and this refers to biljana srbljanovic famous serbian dramatic writer politically she is very active as left oriented liberal and she despises kusturicas political views and anarchism kusturicas everything but not subtle take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop second reference is made to goran bregovic  previous kusturicas composer he formed funeral and wedding orchestra and start performing around europe although he is praised as big composer bregovic is just performer and most of his songs if not all are poor covers of traditional serbian songs kusturicas take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral with funeral mocking the wedding also music is covering western classics as london bridge is falling down or french lullabies you find this unfunny now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovics horrible covers i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody and it is beautifully directed as all of his works are if you like previous kusturicas movies there is a big chance that you will hate this if you dont like couple of his last movies you may find this as pleasant surprise because this is like fellini directing pink flamingos on purpose i have massive respect for this guy after zavet next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth thats the reason why he is most interesting director on earth whether you like it or not
