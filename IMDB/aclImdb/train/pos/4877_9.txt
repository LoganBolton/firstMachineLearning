actually one particular personcharacter isnt right there but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves andor big production sets but with a great story and very believable and good actors conveying the story arcbr br you could call it a companion piece to great japan moviescinema such as tokyo story etc not so much storywise of course but more moodwise great acting nuances in the performances that are truly gems if youre eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally than this is the one to go as you have noticed as with many of my reviews im not getting into the story there are places here at imdb where you can look those up im not one to spoiler the story whatsoever
