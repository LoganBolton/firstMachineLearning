its a funny business reviewing movies these days when internalized emotions and emotional detachment are favored over straightforward sentimentality it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelingsbr br soon after completing jury duties at the 58th berlinale i managed to catch yoji yamadas kabeibr br after the screening i watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall wateryeyed men women and reviewers alike even the director of the berlinale obviously a hardened viewer of cinema confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarters way into this unashamedly sentimental experiencebr br but what really surprised me were the reviews that came after despite being ineffably moved by the film many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally noncommittal in their writing apparently post weeping they had put on their thinking cap and consequently missed out on what i felt was the genius about kabeibr br allow me to explainbr br set in prewar japan the story of kabei revolves around one writers family and their fate therein after he is held in jail for what was described as thought crimes against the imperial will through a series of protracted emotional scenes yamada gets us familiar with the man his loyal wife and two daughters as well as three side charactersthe mans pretty young sister a bumbling exstudent and a cad of an uncle  all come to help the family cope with their plight in the absence of the man of the housebr br the story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict this of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic eventbr br in other words although you learn to love the family and their helpers and sympathize with their unfortunate situation you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of endingbr br however two hours into the film dont worry yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along he slaps you with what i can only describe as the sting all that you have assumed to be what the story was aboutan innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters  now suddenly points to one of the family helpers someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fatebr br at this point something curious happened in the theatre i was in everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibitionbr br my word i muttered under my breath it struck me then that kabei in the final analysis was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war it was in fact a cunning examination of one common human foible how little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to usbr br now the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid but lacked innovation thats what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap i guess with kabei i believe yoji yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity a wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the torasan series and later in tasogare sebeibr br after lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinemabr br this to me is the most effective cinematic tool of all one which avoids detection but affects you deeply and proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of kleenex thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousandseater cinema hallbr br now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about human emotions pure and simple
