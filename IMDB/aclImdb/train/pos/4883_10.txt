we as a family were so delighted with the last of the blonde bombshells we purchased a copy for our home video librarybr br the acting is a1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the musicsongs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the plot as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfoldsbr br full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bellylaugh and lots of music
