its rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme its even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think ive seenbr br a remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i cant really express how good i thought it was so i wont try ill just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
