im so glad i happened to see this video at the store i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem i loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasnt about some beautiful twentysomethings rather its a story of some beautiful sixtysomethings who used used to be twentysomethings its a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well its also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers it left me smiling and ready to watch it again which i did a couple more times before i turned it in i highly recommend it
