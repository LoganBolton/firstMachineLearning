walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to ive heard that before  where ah from kubricks eyes wide shut track 2 got it just as i arrived at the door its waltz no 2 from jazz suite no 2 composed by dimitri shostakovich performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from towers what a treat the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling  there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz its not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ennio morricone beginning notes of track 6 have traces of nuovo cinema paradiso georges delerue and john barry there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp br br emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia  his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him  a relationship alone to them both director marleen gorris of antonias line 1996 academy awards best foreign language film from the netherlands gave us a quietly sensitive film  not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect the frontend subject is the mindgame and mathematical logic of chess beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920s cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss borderbr br i highly recommend the soundtrack if you dont feel like going to the movies alexandre desplats lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete
