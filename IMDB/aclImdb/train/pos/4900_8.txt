this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well low budget cameo type roles well executed the story is a little weak a recently widowed judi dench decides to round up the blonde bombshells a all well almost all girl band who performed during the war in london the obligatory sondaughter who thinks shes gone potty i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they dont have a monopoly on feelings love and even lust that the old wrinklies can have a good laugh too judi dench was superb as always a pity we didnt get to see more of the other blonde bombeshells the end was a little rushed i thought i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm although he was quite adequate as the transvestite drummer all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls
