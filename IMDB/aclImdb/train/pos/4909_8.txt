most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate examble remember the savage bees but ill make an exception for tightrope which almost got it rightbr br heres one that doesnt inevitably get it wrong the accents are not too bad yes the yat accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern the city of 1950 is shown the way it iswas without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky southerner br br one of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot
