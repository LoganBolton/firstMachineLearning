this very good movie crackles with tension the stakes are of course highwill the police and widmark the public health doctor apprehend the criminals who dont know that they are carrying plague before a fullscale epidemic breaks out but smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scenebetween widmark and the police captain between the bad guys played by palance and mostel between palance and a dying plaguestricken man whom palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity between widmark and his wife and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a fullscale panic the movie is beautifully shot by kazan in extraordinarily wellchoreographed long takes shot on location in new orleans and ends in a stunning climax where palance flees like a rat from his pursuers through the docks and warehouses of the city the commentary is superb probably the best that ive heard covering the cinematography the framing and lighting of shots the production design the casting of nonprofessional actors in small roles and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally watch it once to enjoy the film on its own and if you are interested in filmmaking a second time with the commentary on to learn
