the title overstates the content of this movie somewhat which might lead to some unrealized expectations frankly speaking theres very little panic in the streets to be seen here in fact throughout the movie very few people actually know that theres a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters having said that what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because unlike the people in the streets the viewer knows whats going on and that director elia kazan builds very deliberately as the plagueinfected killer is sought one of the more interesting sidebars i found was the developing relationship between dr reed richard widmark and police captain warren paul douglas at the beginning the two really dont like each other even though they have to work together by the end theyve forged a real bond of respect for each other kazan did a good job with thatbr br pretty much all the performances here were excellent widmark and douglas were great and i was quite taken with a very early look at jack palance playing what would become his typical heavy role i found very little to criticize here perhaps barbara bel geddes came across as a little bit flat as reeds wife nancy but her role wasnt really central to the story all in all an excellent piece of work 910
