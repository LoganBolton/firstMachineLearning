take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where theyll be tempted by 26 singles this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous  funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window  let the debauchery flow it was like a reallife version of melrose place the good thing about the show is that it wasnt about people conniving  manipulating each other for a cash prize it was about lust  temptation pure and simple  the ultimate test for a relationshipbr br people either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldnt watch but you cant help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
