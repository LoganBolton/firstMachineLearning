i wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on walter jack palance blackie certainly he looks like no one else of the time that skulllike face flattened nose and elongated body even now he remains an unsettling presence and what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy new orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague blackie is loosing on the city im just sorry he didnt have more scenesbr br the movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgues black humor the widmark douglas interplay the untouristy locations the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time even widmarks domestic scenes that put a woman bel geddes on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive director kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio fox product no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspectbr br widmark does a solid lowkey job as the public health officer but my money is on the one andonly zero mostel was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy eg the enforcer 1950 that scene with mostel where palance argues with mostels shrewish wife liswood is a gem of frantic subservience as mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist i wonder if it was the voluble kazan who named himbr br but its not only the professionals that add color the locals add both character and authenticity especially the two asian guys interviewed by the cops that whole scene has an improvised air as if kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot then too that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration and what about those fleabitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest dennysbr br anyway the movie is still a wellstaged riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of todays megahits
