a neat race against time premise  a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts the murderers think the heat is because the victims infected cousin is holding out on them br br this movie is freely available from the internet archive and its well worth downloading a lot all of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail though to me it does look underexposed even for noir  maybe mobile lighting rigs then werent what they are there is also a plenty of location background noise which is slightly distracting  car horns in the love scene anyone there are a lot of nonprofessional supporting artists in crowd scenes and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with  not much chance for retakes or recasting though the final chase is worth hanging on for theres not much wrong with the lead actors either jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic intelligent psychopath  the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific while widmark as he often did pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level  most of the time br br somebody should remake this  no supernaturals no mysticism no special fx just a good yarn full of character conflict and a topical theme another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy otoole and thats spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark sleazy againsttheclock drama theres even a midget newspaper sellerbr br community what community dyou think youre living in the middle ages
