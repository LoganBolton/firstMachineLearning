just a comment on new orleans accentsbr br an earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewerbr br many people in new orleans do in fact sound broklynese i have never found out why its mentioned in a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often its just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent
