i cant really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think its only just in the categorybr br theres nothing sinister in this piece and thats where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hintsbr br theres no attempt made to question reeds motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played outbr br that lack of depth is what fails the movie in the endbr br the story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you dont remember it from years ago and then putting away
