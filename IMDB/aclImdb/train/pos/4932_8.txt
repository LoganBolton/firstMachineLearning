in panic in the streets richard widmark plays us navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague as cop paul douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest thats not the issue here the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the diseasebr br as was pointed out by any number of people for some reason director elia kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like theyre from louisiana having been to new orleans where the story takes place i can personally attest to that richard widmark and his wife barbara bel geddes can be excused because as a navy doctor he could be assigned there but for those that are natives it doesnt workbr br but with plague out there and the news being kept a secret the new orleans pd starts a dragnet of the citys underworld the dead guy came off a ship from europe and he had underworld connections a new orleans wise guy played by jack palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received noticebr br personally my favorite in this film is zero mostel this happened right before mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies he plays the same kind of role in the humphrey bogart film the enforcer sadly i can kind of identify with mostel in that last chase scene where he and palance are being chased down by widmark douglas and half the new orleans police seeing the weight challenged zero trying to keep up with palance was something else because im kind of in zeros league now in the heft departmentbr br kazan kept the action going at a good clip theres very little down time in this film if there was any less it would be an indiana jones film panic in the streets won an oscar for best original screenplay that yearbr br kazan also made good use of the new orleans waterfront and the french quarter some of the same kinds of shots are later used in on the waterfront in fact panic in the streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest very similar again to on the waterfrontbr br panic in the streets does everyone proud who was associated with it now why couldnt elia kazan get some decent new orleans sounding people in the small roles
