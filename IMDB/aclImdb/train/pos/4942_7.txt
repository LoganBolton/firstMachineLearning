i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost there had been some mildly amusing humour but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time then  for no apparent reason  i suddenly realized that i was enjoying this there was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me in fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie it was as if i just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless  and that in its very pointlessness was its charmbr br morgan freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a “little project” to jumpstart his career hes going to play a supermarket manager and spends the day in a neighbourhood supermarket to research the role while there he meets and bonds with scarlet played by paz vega  a cashier who wants more out of life he helps her prepare for a job interview as if shes auditioning for a role while she introduces him to real life its truly funny watching “him” for thats how the character is identified in the credits be overwhelmed by a visit to the local target storebr br freeman and vega were great together with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but fatherdaughter chemistry if you feel lost at the beginning stick with this in the end it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie 710
