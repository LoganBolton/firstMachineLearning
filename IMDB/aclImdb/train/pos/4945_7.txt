its a difficult movie to classify 10 items or less generally i dont care about defining genres but theres something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category in order to transmit even with only one word your feelings about it i completely recommend this film to anyone and if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life youll want to do the same as soon as youve finished watching it br br i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting its not perfect but it doesnt do anything wrong i dont want to sound like i contradict myself but i believe writerdirector brad silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script im sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection a product that would be as simple appealing and uncompromising as its title well hes done it br br silberling director of long complex dramatic movies like city of angels and moonlight mile proves with 10 items or less which closes in at just 70 minutes the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it to put an actor morgan freeman in front of a woman paz vega in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what silberling proposes here br br i cant tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldnt be underestimated because here everyones exposed the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops thats not endless only because life is life and let me express how praise how well silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time not only in movie duration time but in the single day that the movie develops its events and in a smaller place the kind of connection between two characters that sofia coppola generated in lost in translationbr br that movie set in tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives its in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of 10 items or less and just as in coppolas movie the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words dont seem forced or included in the picture to buy time br br in this aspect the collaboration of silberling and his director of photography phedon papamichael the man who shot the beautiful sceneries in sideways and focused on every emotion in patch adams delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty br br but the ultimate beauty of 10 items or less can be found in its cast by avy kaufman in its two protagonists they are the ones who transmit this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i cant specify we feel their connection and we can tell theyre having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff academy award winner morgan freeman also an executive producer of the film simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry and one thats well deserved a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh and the beautiful paz vega well i said she was great in spanglishÂ…here she proves shes the real deal and hollywoods not small for her
