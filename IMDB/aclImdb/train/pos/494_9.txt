this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earthkind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenographybr br the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war famine etcbr br  the female characters here are two subcommander tpol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and tpol is made to be a vulcan babebr br  some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the tngcrew but creates interesting dynamicsbr br  a very good pilot though for a very good series
