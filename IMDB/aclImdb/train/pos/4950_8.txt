knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting directing and acting and its nice to see when a directorscript get it right clocking in at just 82 minutes 10 items or less doesnt stretch the story trying to grasp at inane topics it stays focused being funny sad and well thought outbr br morgan freeman lucky number slevin stars as him an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him were introduced to him as he travels to a supermarket in an outoftheway section of town by the kid jonah hill click realizing he has a star in his car the kid pressures him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years him isnt very forthcoming because not only has he been out of it for while hes also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in i havent decided if im going to accept the part the kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville stuck him decides to check out the local market he immediately runs into the beautiful scarlet paz vega who operates the 10 items or less register not just strikingly pretty but intelligent him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role he learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated communitybr br but him doesnt just use scarlet he helps her so he can see deeper into her life they travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband and he teaches her how to act to get a new job shes pining for and how to dress for success even when confronted with target as the epitome of local clothing this is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of him too showing his complete lack of understanding of the chainstore retail world these shirts are only 12 bucks how is this possible the ending as stated at the beginning of this review is abrupt but apropos theres no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond they know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other its a quiet but riveting moment as scarlets clunker car sits idling outside hims la mansionbr br this is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going and it wont waste your time either
