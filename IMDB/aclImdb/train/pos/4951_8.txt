in all honesty if someone told me the director of lemony snickets series of unfortunate events city of angels and caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and thatd it be real good id say that person must be joking but thats what director brad siberling did and it was really goodbr br 10 items or less has a similar conceit to films like before sunrise lost in translation or more recently once it involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didnt put them there theyd probably never cross paths or if they did they wouldnt say word one to each other like those films 10 items or less focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each others strengths and weaknessesbr br the story involves morgan freeman playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by paz vega she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary initially freemans character just needs a lift home after spending time with her however he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advicebr br brad siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between freeman and vega the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the films 80 minute duration freeman has fun with his character as he appears an outsider in lower class world that vegas character scarlett inhabits vega in the meantime grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her lifes situation looking to move onbr br there a couple things that really stood out in this film first of all siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesnt fall into any hollywood pitfalls its a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film it works even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivablebr br i am also impressed with the performances while freemans presence gives this film credibility from the getgo he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him paz vega meanwhile is priming herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future i loved her in spanglish and shes equally good here as the tough nononsense scarlet towards the end of the film she successfully conveys the growth of her character im looking forward to seeing her in more filmsbr br overall 10 items of less functions best as a character piece well scripted and directed by brad siberling he hasnt done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films yet theres certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if hell take this road again
