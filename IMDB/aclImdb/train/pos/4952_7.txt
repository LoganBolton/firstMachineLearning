reviewed at the sept 12 2006 2nd screening at the paramount 1 theatre during the toronto international film festival the film had world premiered the day before at the elgin theatre visa screening roombr br the basic plot involves morgan freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc the downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain dvd bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager he soon discovers the reallife market is run by a ironwilled 10 items or less checkout line clerk played by paz vega when freemans ride never returns and vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get freeman back home and to get vega a job thatll get her on a more upwardly mobile career pathbr br while the film was enjoyable it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress there were two extended musical sequences one with vega  freeman teaching each other childrens songs in the car one that literally plays like a paul simon music video that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes longbr br its a good thing morgan freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little sure it was funny in parts and paz vega is a delight as well but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete filmbr br they lost me when morgan freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and paz vega said she never does that who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no in the real world its the exact oppositebr br make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits the bit with a target store saleslady teaching morgan freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious an early bit where freemans chauffeur insists it is freemans voice on a books on tape reading was also pretty funnybr br the directorwriter brad silberling and actress paz vega were there for a brief qa after the screening silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for morgan freeman and that once freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there quite a compliment for both silberlings writing and also about how freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it
