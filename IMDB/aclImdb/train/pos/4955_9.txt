i dont know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthlessbr br what about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his costar gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his moviebr br i thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company when he looks at freeman adoringly and says you make me want to be a woman hes just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her exhusband and his girlfriend is wonderful toobr br in short its a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse
