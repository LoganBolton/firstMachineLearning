br br there is star trek canon  lots of it from canon we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etcbr br enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there  but nobr br the phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect  thats what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure beepbased sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects br br in the earliest view of tos the original pilot the cage we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect  a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprisebr br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series  and that says a lotbr br the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vesselbr br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warmfuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty highrick exploration of spacebr br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully createdbr br enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series lets hope for a good future
