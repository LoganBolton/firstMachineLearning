this is the second baby burlesk short to be released and probably the most popular one is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glorybr br i watched this and i do not understand the kiddieporn that is being claimed it is just a cute little film i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the 80s and 90s that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a mature manner it was more provocative because they werent dressed in diapers theres nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes just a joke i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this that is sick to me if you watch this and are bothered by it then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film all of the bb films were parodies nothing more the parodiesspoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language shouldnt those be more appalling i can watch those without issue but they sometimes take childrens stories and turn them into filth on those parodies that is what should get under your skin not that they babified not a word i know an adult movie from 1926 because we know how pornographic those silent films were huh not to mention those forbidden hollywood precode era films so vile and filthy they would never make such filth today note the sarcasm
