call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you havent had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of voyagers caretaker which launched the series with cpt janeway archers adventures are completely different yet strangely familiarthe music is catchy too no true scifi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episodeand these installments make the wait worthwhile
