while browsing the internet for previous sale prices i ran across these comments why are they all so serious its just a movie and its not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it ive shown it to many of my friends  they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is racy big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much its worth
