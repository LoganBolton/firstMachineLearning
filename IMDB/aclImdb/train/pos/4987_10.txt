though i like ee doc smiths books and david a kyles books of lensman the anime which is loosly based on the books is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fairbr br though the story may seem familiar to scififantasy buffs such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless plus lensman was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once sure it may look a bit outdated now but it is still an innovation if it were not for lensman none of that would have ever happened personally i think computer graphics look better in animation that live actionbr br too bad they only released it on dvdvcd in a few countries in the worls mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different i just wish they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvdvcd in every part of the world not just certain partsbr br ps worsel rules i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well
