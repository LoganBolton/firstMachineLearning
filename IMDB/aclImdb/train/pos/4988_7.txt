mans castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called hoovervilles named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration the proposition of this film is that a mans home is still his castle even when its just a shack in a hoovervillebr br spencer tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much but in a part very typical for tracy before he was cast as a priest in san francisco the start of a slew of classic roles hes playing a tough good natured mug who takes in loretta youngbr br one of the things about mans castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men women had some additional strains put on them if men had trouble finding work women had it twice as hard and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal spence takes loretta young in whos facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle pretty soon though theyre in love though tracy is not the kind to settle downbr br the love scenes had some extra zing to them because tracy and young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of mans castle and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriouslybr br also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp marjorie rambeau whos been through all the pitfalls young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur hohl a really loathsome creep who has his eye on young as well hohl brings the plot of mans castle to its climax through his scheming br br mans castle is grim look at the great depression not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment
