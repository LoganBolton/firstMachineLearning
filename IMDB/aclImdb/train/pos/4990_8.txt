as other reviewers have noted this is an unjustly neglected depressionera film directed by frank borzage two oscars and written by jo swerling leave her to heaven the westerner lifeboat etc it is a toughminded wellstructured and realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown theyre grifters beggars and women forced into prostitution but theyre a community of people both good and bad with loyalties as complex as any groupsbr br perhaps primary among this movies many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracys character bill and loretta youngs trina he toughtalking physically aggressive and evidently fearless but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival while he blusters trina actually hangs tough if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike her devotion to him is obvious and complete when she becomes pregnant she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave or ill even give up the kid if youll only be happy such is the dignity of loretta youngs performance at age 20 as a quite simple character that she seems neither weak or dependent but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more
