i generally find loretta young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways but in this lyrical frank borzage romance and even though shes playing a lowselfesteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy shes direct and honest and irresistible its an odd little movie played mostly in a oneroom shack in a hooverville unusually upfront about the depression yet romantic and idealized tracy playing a blustery hardtotake regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by todays standards softens his characters hard edge and almost makes him appealing theres good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell who never got as far as she should have and jo swerlings screenplay is modest and efficient but the real heroes are borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical closeup and young you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up shes too good for this guy but shes so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion
