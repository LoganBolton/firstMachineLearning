ive seen tons of hk actioners and this one is right at the top of the genre the action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything youve ever seen in any action movie the kung fu is spectacular the pyrotechnics eyepopping the stunt work heartstopping the editing is perfectly paced heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work this film is directed by old pro corey yuen whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre including the jet li vehicle the legend of fong saiyuk if there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a threedimensional character though martin the male lead comes closest to it this movie is full of archetypes rather than charactersthe sexy killer the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend the cackling villains that said shannon lee has a terrific screen presence shes great with the fighting the stunts and the guns when shes onscreen its hard to take your eyes off her shes that good why isnt this woman a major star
