this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies asides from its little plot the weak drama and bits of comedy antics the movie is action packed with gunfighting and martial arts action kept me entertained from beginning until the end i thought shannon lee was awesome in the moviebr br having an action director like corey yuen is what keeps hong kong action going strong this modern action film is highly recommended
