got to this show late  believe it was the 3rd and final episode when first watched it  and was blown away by a social commentary that hasnt been seen on american tv since all in the familybr br was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first placebr br which is merely to say the last time cbs had a set  if you know what i mean  was back in the day of all in the family the most controversial decision theyre willing to tackle today is how much eye makeup to put on katie couricbr br if you want to make a bunch of folks really really mad  let them discover the truth about themselves and if you want them willing to pull strings make calls and get a work of art removed  let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouthsbr br the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve and this show is no different somehow it snuck under the cbs corporatesocialpoliticalcensor radar to get it onto the schedule perhaps the big brass never really watched it till it finally aired but once good ol middle merika heard and saw themselves being themselves  well can bet the farm that message or the messenger wont last longbr br now if only the missing episodes can find their way onto usenet or bittorrent br br thank you bc kelly tallahassee fla
