futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s the origins of off off broadway though its not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution the story is not about being gay though  its about love and sex that dont conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable its not really about animals its about something bigger  stifling conformity in americabr br the stage version won international acclaim in its original production it toured the us and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it luckily we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom ohorgan who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadwaybr br this is not a mainstream easytotake studio film  this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that youll never forget and it just might change the way you see the world
