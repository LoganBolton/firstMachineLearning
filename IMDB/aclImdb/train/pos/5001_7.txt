aardman does it again next to pixar aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properlybr br i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts i thought it translated well for american audiences my only concern is that most of the audiences arent going to get the subtle humor in this showbr br having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this the animators did a great job matching up prerecorded voices to a perfect match animal look at the first episode with the goat who sounds stoned and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other dawgbr br is this for everyone not by a long shot in fact id be happy to see the show last for a full season but like i said before audiences arent going to get it
