i was privileged to have seen some snippets from aardmans original run of this show in the uk it was always fun and always funny none of the charm has been lost in translationits as fresh as the people interviewedwhether some of it is scripted or not as has been rumored is beside the point its always entertainingbr br aardman animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice the single aspect that i probably love most about the show and its concept the hostility between the pandas the porcupines discussing fear of needles the painting ape regulars really grow on you as well such as the horse and donkey teens from maryland most every married couple the parrots the insects and the cats to name a few and childvoiced character and ive really come to dig the ferret mondays finally become a day to which to look forward
