i wasnt going to watch this show but im glad i did the critics of this just dont get it its one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on tv at the present moment though when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless but put them in the mouth of animals and insects and its a laugh riot i laughed so hard i had tears in my eyes the pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless the husband and wife birds talking about health problems and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up creature comforts is the most imaginative show ive ever seen in awhile hopefully it will be back next summer when this run is over
