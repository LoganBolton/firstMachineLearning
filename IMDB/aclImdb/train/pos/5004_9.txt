but just as entertaining and random love it or hate it but dont expect a sophisticated plot or nailbiting cliffhanger think of it like seinfeld but without the followthrough and repeat performances of wacky characters wellso far i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season continuesbr br creature comforts is not for the faint of humour  its meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your brains part which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what im missingbr br funnier than most of todays sitcoms calmer than an evening at nascar just the right mix of dead air and comebacks cant wait for the next one
