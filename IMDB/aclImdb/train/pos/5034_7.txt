frailty is a nongory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a mans delusionobsession straight into depravity dad we never learn his name is a gentle man and loving father whos raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son adam the familys world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys room and tells them god has given him a vision and what a vision  the entire familys job is to destroy demons who of course are disguised in human formbr br proceeding from this premise the movie is unflinching in following it dad kidnaps peopledemons whom god has told him to destroy binds them lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil then kills them  while making his young sons watch fenton the older boy is horrified seeing only a father whos turned into a crazed murderer adam the younger is uncomfortable but trusts that dad is following gods will eventually dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the demons that god has put on dads list and finally invites them to fully participate in gods mission for the familybr br this is not you understand an abusive father he loves his children he is only following gods instructions this is our job now son weve got to do this when fenton terrified and convinced his father has gone mad says hell report him to the police his father explains if you do that son ill die the angel was clear on this the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic and warps their entire lives1 the movies structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects a story in flashback told in a police station to a fbi agent the moody lighting the stormy weather and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story until i remembered the reallife parallel of andrea yates who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them even then i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy rather than a story of divine retributionbr br the movie gave me no such comfort though as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dads vision and this as much as some plot holes posed a problem for me regardless of the accuracy of dads visions regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death 1 roger ebert review 41202
