mcconaughey in a horrorthriller i had to see this i was pleasantly surprisedbr br the plot is told in flashback mode and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament i cant say much more without spoiling the whole movie sorry just know that if you decide to watch it youll be in the very least surprisedbr br all the main players are very good bill paxton did a great job directing those kids and his acting is awesome mcconaugheys acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectlybr br this movie challenges you to think is dad crazy is there a god do demons exist how far would you go to right a wrong and what is right anyway im still thinkingbr br and thus i recommend frailty 710 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second or even third viewing
