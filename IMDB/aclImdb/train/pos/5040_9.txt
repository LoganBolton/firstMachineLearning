i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven not really a fan of either star i still wanted to see it because im a huge thriller fanbr br i was not disappointed the acting was superb especially from the two young boys usually i loathe child actors but young adam and young fenton were excellent bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too it was beautifully shotbr br one must also note the plot twists the three twists at the end hit hard and fast and i didnt see them coming the final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though ive rewatched the film so many timesbr br a true gem
