the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect its a very good thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill paxtons directorial debut though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version br br still there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton br br its a solid story with some great twists at the end several of them all believable all fun and best of all obscured well enough to make them true twists br br the child actors in the movie do a great too im usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects but both these kids do a good jobbr br this movie is not gory its not very scary but it is very very creepy
