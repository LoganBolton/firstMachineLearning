we really enjoyed grey owl a simple tale well told in classic attenborough fashion a little overromanticized with archetypes humor and a stress of dignity and valuesbr br beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of archie an englishman who turned native indian and went to live and trap in canadabr br solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewingbr br two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen  and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings it must have been great to meet or read grey owl in the 1930s a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute
