okay ill admit the casting in the film is really strangepart of this is due to the plot but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead though he really did a pretty good jobbr br its based on a true story of an englishman who went to live with the canadian indians in the early 20th century he claimed to be a mixed blood indian he was in fact so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness trekseven though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked the movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncoveredbr br the acting and settings were great and i really liked the film once i suspended disbelief about brosnan it didnt get widespread distributionprobably because it was pretty cerebralnot a bond film nor a romancejust a really odd film about a remarkable man
