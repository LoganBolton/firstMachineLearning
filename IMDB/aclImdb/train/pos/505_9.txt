a very good start i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race too bad they couldnt have picked jeri ryan i like ms park the koreanlady the doctor has possibilities havent sorted out the other males except for the black guy hes a really likeable bakula needs to find his nichein ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything he is of course big and strong enough for the heroics the heavies were ok although i didnt like their makeup
