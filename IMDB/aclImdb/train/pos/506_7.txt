a strong pilot this twohour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clich√©candycolored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to tpol as seven of vulcanbut the ensemble looks strong the characters are welldrawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier later series scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirks brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer not just a glorified phone operator anymore as supporting players the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift its starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added laterwhich i hope happens because after about a halfdozen episodes more variety will be needed
