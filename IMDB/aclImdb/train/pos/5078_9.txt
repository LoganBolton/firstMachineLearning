this one stood out for its originality im seriously tired of seeing hindi movies that are a hotchpotch of a whole bunch of hollywood and brit movies some flaws were inevitable nonetheless this movie is a mustsee suryas portrayal of the cleancut conscientious cop as opposed to the potbellied moneyhungry ones that we normally see was awesome hes come a long way from his work in nerukku ner i liked the movie so much that i had to own it im not usually into the mindless violence type of movies somehow i actually felt for each character and therefore cant really bring myself to call it mindless violence i do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most hindi and tamil movies i absolutely loved this movie for its lack of the same acp anbuselvans reaction to loosing his wife is not overdone is heartwrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out there are certain times when im watching a movie when i want to hit the ff button plenty of times ive wanted to do that at a cinema hall never wanted to do so when watching this movie im really hoping that ghajini releases soon
