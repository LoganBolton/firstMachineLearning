this movie was terrific and even with a less than convincing ending its still well worth seeing the film begins as claudette colbert is about to marry robert ryan when the minister asks if anyone has any objections a guy jumps up and announces that colbert cant get married because she already is married colbert insists this isnt true but when they investigate they find that the justice of the peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license slowly it becomes apparent that claudettes mind is slipping and people around her seriously doubt her sanity then when the supposed first husband is murdered all evidence and suspicion falls on colbertbr br the film is an exciting mystery suspense film as what i have so far described is only the first half of the movie what follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating unfortunately the conclusion though is a bit of a letdown as the guiding force behind all this turns out to come right out of left fieldand is baffling since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer however in spite of this the film was so good i can even excuse the limp ending in particular robert ryan did a great job as the knucklebusting fianc√© though apart from him the other performances were also excellent
