true it does not follow the book very closely but its still a very entertaining take on the story swayze was far better in the role than i expected and doody avoided the silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness portrayal most of us probably expected cf kate capshaw in indiana jones  the temple of doombr br at any rate its amazingly better than richard chamberlains awful pair of quatermain flicksbr br it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways about the only thing i didnt care for was all the mysticism but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre like how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen heh
