if you a purist dont waste your time  otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart grangerdeborah kerr version  ive seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i wont detail the differences because it would spoil the film also it is a pleasure to see alison doody again im a huge indiana jones fan patrick swayze is good as quatermain and the supporting cast is superb i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment you wont be disappointed
