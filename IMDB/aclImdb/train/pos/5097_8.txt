this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isnt on any of her collectionsthe reason why is probably because it doesnt have a happy endingunlike all her other filmsits also not a musicalalthough she does belt out one song called the world owes me a livingthe film was made in 1934 and originally in black and whitethe version i have is in colour and on vhsi would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realisticunlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadfulthe film is good for its age and the story hasnt dated at allim surprised no one has tried to do a remakeat times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in fivealthough dont be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in itespecially when jerrygary cooper steals a necklaceand hides it in shirleys teddy bearthe tension and slow build up to his actionswhile at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another roomis very well directedgary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very goodin all this is a good film from the early 30saccept it for its age
