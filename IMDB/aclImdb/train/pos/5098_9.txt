even longtime shirley fans may be surprised by now and forever the movie was filmed with paramount studios  not with shirleys parent company twentieth century fox  in 1934 before fox producer darryl zanuck had perfected the successful shirley formula cute songs cold hearts for her to melt young couples for her to play cupid to happy endings thus now and forever falls into the category of a shirley vehicle without the standard shirley story it is an awkward position for any movie but this impressive talented cast makes it workbr br gary cooper and carole lombard star as funloving irresponsible con artists jerry and toni day the only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart when they are suddenly landed with custody of jerrys young daughter penny shirley temple it is toni  and not penny as many believe  who persuades jerry to give up his criminal career but jerry flounders at his desk job and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty in a standard shirley device penny tries to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon felix evans the victim of one of jerrys cons but her attempt fails for evans is revealed to be a con artist himself and he blackmails jerry into helping him steal jewels the drama gunfight death and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for little miss sunshine there is no happy ending no dancing and only one song sequence the cute number the world owes me a livingbr br but this does not mean that shirley fans should avoid now and forever rather its divergence from the usual shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films but beware you should avoid colorized version of this film and see it in blackandwhite if you can the color is bright garish and unrealistic and in many scenes shirleys famous curls are actually red instead of blonde yikes
