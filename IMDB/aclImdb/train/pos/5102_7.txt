dont mind the soundtrack which is played out by nowbr br still debra winger is always interesting and while this was an earlier role for her she is quite good as cissy girl from the wrong side of the tracks lived in trailer with bud travolta only to be replaced for a time by city slicker madolyn smith as a rivalbr br i agree with an earlier review regarding scott glenn he is used for plot only thrown in to the mix to create suspense the story is predictable and contrivedbr br also even though i am from the east many of us did not like saturday night fever while it had its moments the perpetual stereotypes are beyond criticism at this pointbr br worth seeing for debra winger she is still so likable and never had that hollywood persona we are subjected to by too many actresses today 710
