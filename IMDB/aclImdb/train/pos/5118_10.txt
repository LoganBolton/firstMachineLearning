spoilerscarefulbr br what can i say im biased when it comes to urban cowboy i love it and have watched it countless timesand usually find out something new about it with each viewingbr br i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people not rich people who live in either la or new york well it is true except for pambr br travolta plays bud a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guysgood guys in big budget movies this is a really good moviethe mechanical bull riding contest and twostep dancing may be silly but you have to enjoy this for what it isbr br bud meets sissy played by debra winger with slutty brillianceand soon after they are married and living in their dream trailer but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes bud wants to be a real cowboy sissy wants to be with a real cowboy but in modern times mens roles are not as clear where can bud prove hes a real man he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by nighthe can be a urban cowboy but sissy wants to drive his pickup truck and she wants to ride the mechanical bull too so where does this leave bud as sissy asserts her independence she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the excon and prison rodeo stara real bull rider wes played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn bud is threatened and bud and sissy break upbr br sissy shacks up with wes who abuses her emasculating himself further bud becomes the boy toy of pam a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies sissy comes by the trailer to clean it uppam doesnt do that kind of thing she writes a make up letter to bud but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissys houseworkbr br buds uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation but are too stubborn later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilleys and you know bud is going to win pam realizes that bud doesnt love her but sissyhe did it for her wes tries to rob gilleys but wouldnt you know that urban cowboy bud saves the day and wins back the woman he lovesbr br of course you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and live like pigs maybe that contributed to their bad marriage or why didnt bud stay with pamshe wasnt that bad and had money or why they had to kill off uncle bob or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up marshall says to bud she sissy rides that bull better than you do but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bitand saying isnt that bonnie raitt on the stage
