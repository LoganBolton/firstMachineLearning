i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilleys had low ceilingsperhaps 1012 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smokefilled bar hung 24 feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the lowlevel of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was auxiliary lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be lowlight shots ray villalobos the camera operator was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks raygreat work
