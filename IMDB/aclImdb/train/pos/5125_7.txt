i bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering texas day but was pleasantly surprised after suffering through saturday night foolishness i had no desire to see a remake in some south texas barnyardand i didnt john revolta was good as the jealous redneck scott glenn was well cast as a thuggie excon and debra winger was as always a delight love that woman plus the soundtrack was dynamite and this comes from a guy that cant stand the sound of country music a fun film all the way
