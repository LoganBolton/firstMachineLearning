for urban cowboy john travolta plays one of the stronger alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen hes a decent enough young kid who leaves his parents homestead and strikes out for the big city of dallas where his uncle barry corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry in 1980 that was beginning to boom and texas was definitely a growing place in the usabr br travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig he meets and marries debra winger whos from the same background but shes got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men and when she beats him at gilleys mechanical bull a mans game thats it for himbr br scott glenn whos an exconvict is working at gilleys and this film was his breakout role hes a real snake in urban cowboy he gets travoltas goat with a mere look and he moves in on winger travolta in turn takes up with rich girl madolyn smith osborne whos slumming at gilleys br br despite the characters urban cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the selfstyled biggest honky tonk in the world gilleys is no longer there in the suburban texas community of pasadena but the memories do live on and the best thing about urban cowboy is the wonderful score of countrywestern songs that were featured in the film im not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for urban cowboy but its the only reason i can think of why the motion picture academy ignored the musical aspects of this film i especially liked johnny lees looking for love if it was specifically written for this film its a disgrace that it wasnt nominated for best songbr br i liked debra wingers character best in this film she doesnt lose a trace of femininity but she stands up to travolta and does it in style and this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bullrider in the professional bull riders
