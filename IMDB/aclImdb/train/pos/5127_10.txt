okay so i have come a long way from houston by now but whenever i see this movie i am taken back to a little cowgirls dream to one day ride the bull at gilleys it burned down before i was of drinking agebr br if you grew up in in east texas then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time if you didnt then trust me and watch the movie either you will join the many who love it and at the same time strangely repulsed or at the very least you can make fun of the rednecks there is plenty material for poking fun this movie doesnt try to be pc what was that in the 80s or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and placebr br gotta be a 10 for me
