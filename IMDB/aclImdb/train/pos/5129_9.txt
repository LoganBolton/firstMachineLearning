i can see why this film was oscarnominated for best live action short as it was constructed masterfully even if you dont particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i cant see why director gjon mili only got to direct one filmthis one in other words the film is nominated and yet the director didnt get any sort of career boost as for the black performers i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear as unfortunately most of white society have indifference or worse for blacks or that kind of musicbr br if you do watch this film if you arent particularly enjoying the earlier portion skip ahead to about the 550 markwhere it picks up considerably when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise the pace improved quite a bit
