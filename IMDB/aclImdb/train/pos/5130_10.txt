may seem like an overstatement but it is notbr br what is so hard to comprehend is  why didnt they make more musical shorts like this wasnt the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved i guess not so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there this is one exception  the only one  where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art why didnt anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date crazy manbr br a pity there were no sequels if youve seen anything of similar quality please share it
