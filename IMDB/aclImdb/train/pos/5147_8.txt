first week of may every year brings back the memories of the holocaust through movies on televisions among many movies they showed this was the one i had not seenbr br the story is about hilters life and how he came to power it starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in germanybr br the movie was earlier presented as a tv series and later converted into a movie format scottish actor robert carlyle plays adolf hitler with great guts conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this manbr br it is a good screenplay and narrative that educates the audiences on the main events that lead hitler into power and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of hitler the movie is a biased viewpoint of the director christian duguay  who shows hitler as a onetrack menacing angry and shouting person  who had such a strong hold on the germans and people around him hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction and there the movie fails to convince hitlers portrayalbr br even though the venture was for tv all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie the production value sets costumes etc were perfectbr br there is a lot of criticism of this movie in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented but still the movie is gripping every engaging and entertaining robert carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does he is amazingly good  brilliant i would have liked a more balanced view of hitlers life because i think hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust as i have told several times that  very sadly  our society loves to garland or prosecute one person as a representative of the societys good or evil respectively
