i dont know what it is with this movies but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy of course its not 100 accurate its difficult to make 100 accurate films nowadays when even the experts disagree with each other therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuraciesbr br so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast the series should have been a three part story his childhood being the first part but if they didnt have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise thatbr br theres only one real problem i have with this movie and thats the fact that its told in a history book way especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane more scenes where he doubts himself etc noah taylor did that more in the movie max which seem to work better i think nevertheless im glad this was made and own it on dvd just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best 7510
