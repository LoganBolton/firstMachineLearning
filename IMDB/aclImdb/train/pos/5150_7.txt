even though ian kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to hitlers life and yes this is dramatised but essential robert carlyle plays hitler during his later years during this documentary that only deals with hitler from boyhood until he became chancellor of germany including the night of the long knives this tvfilm also a twopart miniseries shows how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power eg the financial disaster of 1930br br the series follows hitler and little else apart from the lives of fritz gerlich and ernst hanfstaengl all in all valuable and filled with interesting actors yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography most actors are portrayed in halfbody shots which for me makes for a theatrical stance not cinematic the tempo is at times drowsy and the film does suffer from it being approximately 25 hours long
