hitler the rise of evil was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the filmbr br those who criticzed the film which they hadnt seen did so with good intentions based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler however they misunderstood the point to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of historys greatest villains were committed by a human being a sick diseased maniac to be sure but a human being nonetheless it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening againbr br rise of evil is highlighted by a brilliant career best performance from robert carlyle who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in the bunker another very good madefortelevision film while were are repulsed by hitlers depravity and virulent antsemitism carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed after all while else would a nation have followed himbr br of the various subplots by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich who makes it his lifes work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism while modines performance is a little stilted in part 1 by part 2 he seems to have settled in the character gives us a reallife hero in a film full of villains peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong supportbr br part 1 of this twopart mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy including a look at hitlers childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2 sections detailing hitlers relationships with his niece and his mistress eva braun are less successful than the central plot but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional statebr br ultimately no film about hitler can make us understand him the average person is thankfully incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people hitler the rise of evil tries less to make us understand hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions and the capability of doing anything but goodbr br 9 out of 10  12
