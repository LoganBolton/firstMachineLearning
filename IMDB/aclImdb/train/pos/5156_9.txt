i agree with many of the negative reviews posted here for reasons i will go into later on but this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of hitlers worldbr br peter stormare is perfect as ernst rohm the brutal brownshirt leader each scene he has with hitler is explosive hitler is so evil he dominates everyone but the thuggish primitive rohm  and he clearly digs rohm for just that reason the interplay between stormare and carlisle illuminates the way hitler relished rohms brutality but later sacrificed him for political reasonsbr br jena malone turns in a heartrending performance as geli raubal hitlers doomed niece and the victim of his unspeakable perversions without revealing any of the sexual filth directly jena malone plays out all the horror of the slow extinction of a young girls spirit she uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come and shes brilliant zoe telford very nearly matches jena malone with her portrayal of eva braun eva is clearly sick cruel and heartless  but at the same time almost pitiably dependent on her adolphs twisted tenderness the aborted lovemaking scene between them hinting at the spine tingling truth of hitlers enormous selfloathing is both chilling and eroticbr br liev schrieber gives a deliciously weasellike performance as putzi hanfstaengel the spineless manabouttown who is seduced by hitlers promises of wealth and power while a brute like rohm simply loves the idea of crushing skulls under his boots schriebers character is one of many germans who abhors nazi violence but cant resist the quick and easy route to money and power his weakwilled fawning over hitler soon loses him the respect of his wife played with style and sensuality by the stunning and regal julianna margulies they provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayalbr br these performances carry the mini series along easily overcoming occasional weaknesses in the script there is one exception regrettably matthew modines acting chops just arent up to snuff his noble lunkhaid journalist ruins every scene he has  the viewer can hardly wait for rohms brownshirts to stomp that smug righteous look off his ignorant cornpone lowrent hollywood golden boy face but the story still worksbr br now in regard to the factual inaccuracies of the script  hitlers perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant compelling drama but the battlefield record of corporal hitler is badly distorted as if afraid the audience cant handle the idea of evil and courage in the same person the writers make hitler look like a whining coward who begged for an iron cross as if anyone in the kaisers army could get a medal just by whining about it the movie makes it look as if hitler were a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier they also suggest his comrades despised him when in reality he was widely admired by officers and enlisted men alike the depressing thing is that the miniseries succeeds so well in representing hitler as a monster in honest ways  but they just couldnt resist the cheap shotbr br all in all however hitler rise of evil is a soaring success highlighted by powerful performances
