i remember the first time i saw this movie  i was in the office working over the weekend  the tv was on for background noise but i gradually found myself more  more engaged in this movie id never seen or heard of until i was completely absorbed a matter of life  death the british title  stairway to heaven in the us is delightful compelling whimsical  moving all in one superblywritten wellacted perfectlydirected package its a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca its a wonderful life gone with the wind citizen kane  chariots of fire why has it never received the same public notice  videostore prominence fortunately some knowledgeable critics have put it on their top 100 of all time lists there is hope  1940s fantasia wasnt a hit til the 60s  the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office but made a hit by tv buy it  rent it  watch it  demand it you wont be disappointed
