an unusual take on time travel instead of traveling to earths past the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet they beam down to this planet whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours thats cutting it close in some kind of futuristic library they meet mr atoz a to z get it haha and his duplicates it turns out instead of escaping their planets destruction via space travel the usual way the inhabitants have all escaped into their planets various past time eras mr atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection check out the discs we see here another trek prognostication of cds and dvds when mr atoz prepares the machine the atavachronwhatsis gallant kirk hears a womans scream and runs into the planets version of earths 17th century where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery theres an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time using phrasing of the time youre a bully fine coo witch witch theyll burn ye spock  mccoy follow kirk but end up in an ice age 5000 years earlierbr br kirk manages to get back to the library first the real story here is spocks reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago this doesnt really make sense except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change even so spock  mccoy werent prepared by atoz  oh well it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately  he mentions being from millions of light years away instead of the correct hundreds or thousands  a gross error for a logical vulcan in any case spock really shows his nasty side here  forget day of the dove and remember this side of paradise  mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged spock also gets it on with zarabeth a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment a couple of trek novels were written about spocks son the result of this union all these scenes are eyeopeners a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in its also ironic that only a few episodes earlier requiem for methuselah mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love  and now all this happens kirk meanwhile tussles with the elderly atoz who insists that kirk head back to some past era you are evidently a suicidal maniac  great stuff from actor wolfe last seen in bread and circuses it all works out in the end but like i mentioned earlier they cut it very close a neat little trek adventure with a definite cosmic slant
