i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channelsurfing before going to bed and really liked what i saw since then ive been on the lookout scouring tv listings flipping through dvdvhs racks at stores but didnt find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it then being a worldclass procrastinator i still didnt order it finally i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland or a few weeks ago then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching itbr br so what do i think about the film its good not as good as i remembered and hoped for but still well worth the 999 it cost me after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 710 with potential to become an 810 ill have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue
