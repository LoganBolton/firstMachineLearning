if i could go back even as an adult and relive the days of my summers spent at campi would be there so fast the camps i went to werent even this great they were in texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing the movie cinematography was astounding the characters funny and believable especially perkins pollack and arkin sam raimis character and subantics were priceless so who ever thought this movie was lamei have deep pity for because they cant suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity i wish i could it was funny intelligent beautifully scripted brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even sorta like dances with wolves and ladyhawkgood movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors rent it see it buy it and watch it over and over and overnever gets old 0
