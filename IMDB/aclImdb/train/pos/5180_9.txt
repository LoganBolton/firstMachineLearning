there is this private campground in plymouth massachusetts thats been around since 1959 my grandparents were among its founders my parents had a site starting in 1965 and my two brothers have sites there nowbr br this doesnt have anything directly to do with the movie bear with me br br i spent summers at blueberry hill from when i was five years old to when i was eighteen and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was as my fiancée tells of me the good and happy place if youve never experienced the lifestyle indian summer will probably be lost on you dont bother its not quickpaced it doesnt have rapid cuts the plots arent in the least bit convoluted it has no explosions such dramatic tension as exists is mild there arent any alist actors there are no rapidfire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are other than perhaps kimberley williams killer line about how her fiancé shouldnt overwind his toys that is not the least degree what this movie is about any more than the godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gorebr br but indian summer is godfathers polar opposite if you have experienced the lifestyle see this movie dont read any more just do itbr br for me this is a 910 film
