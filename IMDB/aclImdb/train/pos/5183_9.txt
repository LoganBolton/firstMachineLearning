br br this movie is by far one of my favorites i saw it while in college in the early 90s and while i couldnt identify with the thirtysomethings in the film i felt that the story characters and movie in general were top notch to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer feel free to stick to your overblown armageddontype movies and leave the movies with a great wholesome story to those who can appreciate them
