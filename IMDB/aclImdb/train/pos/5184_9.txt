deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups bill paxton julie warner kevin pollak elizabeth perkins vincent spano matt craven and diane lane who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka a camp in ontario canada by their former consuelor alan arkin writerdirector mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense also the movie has plenty of funny moments some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite the one involves using masking tape newton thomas sigel the usual suspects three kings provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness among the cast sam raimi director of the evil dead films and the gift appears here as arkins bumbling righthand man one more thing this film reassured me that a camp doesnt have to be a site of bloody murders
