i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode collections or when scifi would rerun the episodes however when scifi would host the reruns they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didnt repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase
