human tornado 1976 is in many ways a better film than its predecessor the director knew what he had to work with and catered towards rudy ray moores limitations as an actor its a fun movie thats more technically sound and acted the performers dont take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow rudy ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in dolemitebr br i enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it just like his first film its catered towards a certain audience i highly doubt that mr moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career check it outbr br highjly recommended
