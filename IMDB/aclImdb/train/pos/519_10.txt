i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it its beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time its difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think im not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now im able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in postwar british films to watch this
