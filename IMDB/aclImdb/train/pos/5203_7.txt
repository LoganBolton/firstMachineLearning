honestly i was expecting to hate this one and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in itbut i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace the group of postteens is warned by the propertys caretaker not to venture into the woods  but being the stupid bmovie characters that they are  of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake onebyone first off there is plenty wrong with evil breed the actingdialog is pretty weak and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson chasey lain ginger lynn and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here  and jennas role in this production is grossly overhyped as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time even less with chasey and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like its thrown in just to end the film those gripes aside  there is some good stuff as well richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on with greicos nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chaseys guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isnt shown onscreennot bad for the first 5 minutes the other kill scenes are pretty inventive including jennas forced breast implant removal a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass a knife through the face and a few other notables the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and its a shame the producers made them chop em so to speak also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you dont really have too much time to be bored the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps overall evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected this one along with satans little helper have almost renewed my interest in american lowbudget straighttovideo films i usually steer clear of them as a whole but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith evil breed is no masterpiece but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes  might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while youre at it  i know i was and im sure it didnt hurt the experience 7510
