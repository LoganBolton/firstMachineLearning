i dont watch much porn but i love porn stars and i love gory movies so when i heard about a pornstar gore movie i was really excited of course that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie i never thought id actually get to see it but i did and im not ashamed to admit i loved it even with all its flawsbr br first the flaws the story is set in ireland and is called samhain but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland so why not just set it there and skip the thirdgrade report about samhainirish immigrantshalloween also it breaks its own rules by stating that youre safe on the trails but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere its never clear how many cannibals were dealing with theres a big stone castle thats obviously ancient yet no ones noticed it before the selfconscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met the ending makes no sensebr br so what works the gore sure i would have liked more but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasnt afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd ive always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that
