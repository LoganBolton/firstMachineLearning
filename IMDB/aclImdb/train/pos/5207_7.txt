if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars its not as if theyre inexperienced in front of the camera they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hardgore effects and so he cast four of adult cinemas sexiest and most notorious stars jenna jameson chasey lain ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genrebr br samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october 2002  thus keeping in check with the halloweenbased synopsis unfortunately the shoot was plagued by numerous problems which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves last i heard it had been signed by film 2000 here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up they were also responsible for unleashing granny bleed and the rancid paranoid could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon br br five canadianamerican students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake but its rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacrefodder does in these flicks the mandatory goody twoshoes and definite heroine candidate begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest well what do you think br br it looks as if samhains production was jinxed right from the start almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jamesons nude makeup shots and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a druggedout primadonna finally to add insult to injury the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of reediting and removing all the gore reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating veil of course disagreed seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display eventually after months of arguments the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaultsbr br despite countless disruptions veils slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium the copy i was sent was the prerelease screener which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack but still it boasted a few credible jumpscares some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that ive seen for some time one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up spilling her guts after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard grieco even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome samhain never feels mean spirited which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichés in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes cravens scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from thembr br certainly the inclusion of the mouthwatering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes but samhain is no soft porn movie and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce its worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost outperform the supposed actors of the feature which isnt much of a complement ginger lynn was at least notable if you ignore the shameful oirish accent and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics which could have been caused by the numerous problems onset veils direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some muchneeded injections of suspense exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore houndsbr br it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending and im curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched then its still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years this one is certainly worth checking out
