star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning br br a notably bad actor getting by on his now fading looks rather than any strong dramatic talent richard gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the american hollywood scene always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today but nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to dvdlimited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte nowbr br he has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened cynical case worker earl babbage one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the us who along with his new protégé allison allthrop claire danes must take to his latest case delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages agobr br this is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing and as such its a pretty strong compelling film unflinching and not constrained by its direct to dvd budget the only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while but its still some of the solidest material ive seen gere in relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on
