this is the first review ive wrote for imdb so bare with me but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agentdetective who bends the rules to get the job done i think the story is great and theres never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking but if youve ever seen a crime film like se7en youll be able to stomach the scenes just fine br br so all in all if youre looking for a good detectivesuspense movie ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it
