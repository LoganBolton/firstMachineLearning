all i can say is first movie this season that got my attention i picked it because of the actors gere and claire and the story looked promisingi have just watched it and i can say  im overwhelmed there are shocking scenes truebut thats what makes it more realistic we shouldnt run away from our reality these things are happening right this moment and there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better and who get laughed out about their commitment to the cause actually i cant seem to feel the hollywood touch in the movieand thats what makes it better both claire and richard did a great roles and deserve a 10 from me
