after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock theres just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that hes finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them clare danes was also super as his traineereplacement some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i dont see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadnt heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as 7even well maybe and youll see better acting out of gere than anyones ever gotten out of pitt
