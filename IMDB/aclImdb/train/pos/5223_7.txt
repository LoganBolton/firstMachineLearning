it does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people first off not many seem to have seen it in the first place i just bumped into it by accident and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very muchbr br well i did i usually tolerate gere for his looks and his charm and even though i did not consider him a great actor i know he can do crazy pretty well i liked his mr jones but this performance is all different he is not pretty in this one and he is not charming his character is completely different from anything i had seen from him up to that pointold ugly broken determined and gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully i guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it insteadthink hopkins as hannibal lecter or washington as alonzo in training day that is how good gere was herebr br the rest of the cast were fine by me too i guess i would not have cast danes in this role mostly because i think she is too goodlooking for it but she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a gere in top form which is no small feat strickland easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her i actually think she owns the key scene with gere and danes and that is quite an achievementbr br so what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting the story is perhaps not hugely surprising some 8mmish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the whodunnit and also like silence of the lambs adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of geres character all that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life thats a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to thembr br direction and photography were adequate i could have done without the modern musicvideo camera movements and cutting but then i am an old curmudgeon and it really wasnt all that bad in fact i think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isnt a happy onebr br worth seeing
