what is with all of the european especially england comments here all i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great of course its stupid thats the point you have to see the movie dr strangelove and men in black to get the whole joke behind this movie but come on people what did you expect to see i can think of many movies that are far worse than this and they were expensive hollwood films with real actors in them for what its worth men in white is a very stupidfunny mock of a movie and with all the stupidfunny stuff that england has been making for the last half century i am shocked at all the negative comments us stupid americans like our stupid humor ps see team america world police for some true laughs that europeans will especially like ha
