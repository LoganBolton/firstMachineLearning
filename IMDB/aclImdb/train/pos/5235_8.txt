the plot doesnt begin to describe the film a man is writing a film or rather this film its totally self referential to the point that you think its going to fold in on itself like a black hole the writer writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about itbr br its very philosophical like waking life but more zen oriented and for that matter much better in my opinion at one point there are persononthestreet interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines there is beautiful scenery and optical illusionsbr br i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully seen at cinequest the san jose ca film festival on 2252002
