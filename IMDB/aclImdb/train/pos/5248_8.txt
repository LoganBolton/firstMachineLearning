okay like many other such films spawned out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute onedimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character he drops amusingly consistentlythreated oneliners with fair frequency billy dee williams is in it though his lando days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well true its not great art but if you went into waynes world looking for the gone with the wind you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is
