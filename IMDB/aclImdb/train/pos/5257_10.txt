i must say this movie has given me a dual personality ive been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person but its very hard no not the wang did you find that disgusting and disrespectful well get in the mood for a lot more this movie is just filthy its not a film to show your grandparents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace anyway back to the voice mannerisms fortunately this site has some ladies man did anyone at the studio notice that theres supposed to be a apostrophe between the e and s so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops i have a sheet in my wallet
