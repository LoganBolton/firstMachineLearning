do you like really inventive comedy or do you love the wedding crashers if the answer is the latter stop reading now i cant believe this movie is not higher rated basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin powersthere are so many inventive moments in this gagorama from crudity  leon playing with himself on the porch the ex boyfriend tricked into eating   oh well to inspired lunacy clown sex  the broadway routine the voice over meadows is great as the childish but very sweet natured leon some great lines dont blame the wang freaky deaky sex world too many   why this movie wasnt huge is a mystery great comedy
