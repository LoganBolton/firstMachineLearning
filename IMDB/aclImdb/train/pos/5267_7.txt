apparently ruggero deodato figured out early on that his story wouldnt work if he approached it too seriously so he decided to camp it up the result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous swordandsorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy and i think ill go the second way the brief gore moments are welldone the paul brothers openly mock the material they even bark at each other in one scene and there is also a charming spirited goodnatured performance by eva la rue as the girl who tags along with the boys plus where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque
