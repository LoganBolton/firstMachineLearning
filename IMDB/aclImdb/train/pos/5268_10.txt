the barbarians maybe´s not the best film that anybody of us have seen but reallyit´s so funnyi can´t discribe how mutch i laughed when i first saw itthe director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie but it´sso misirable badso bad that it´s one of the funniest movies i´ve ever seenso my advise is that you should see itand if you alredy did se it again
