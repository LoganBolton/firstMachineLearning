as shallow as it may sound i actually delayed my viewing of the barbarians several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isnt so much gayÂ… just trashy cheesy campy and enormously fun its almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato director of cannibal holocaust of all people was the man responsible for this comical cashin on the contemporary popular sword  sandal fantasy flicks particularly schwarzeneggers conan movies the film opens with a terrific onceuponatime type of offscreen narrator introducing us to the ragneks their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers in other words the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby meanwhile and as some sort of amusing waste of time the two orphan twinbrothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and theyre unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death instead of that however they escape and develop a plan to free their queen actually the plot isnt half as bad as i initially feared but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers on screen chemistry the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasymonsters like a dragon with adorably cute eyes some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp the soundtrack and makeup effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace the barbarian brothers acting capacities are much better than i anticipated apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds the supportive cast is splendid as well eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donutshaped hair style i kid you not last but not least the barbarians stars everybodys favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people but the barbarians really is a mustsee italian exploitation highlight
