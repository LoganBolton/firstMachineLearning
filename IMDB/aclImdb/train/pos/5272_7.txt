deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesnt take itself too seriously absolutely a classic in its own particular kind of way this movie provides a refreshingly different look at barbarians if you get a chance to see this movie do so youll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time not because its funny or anything mundane like that but because its so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good though maybe not clean fun
