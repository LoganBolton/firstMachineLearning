yes i loved this movie when i was a kid when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn outbr br my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system at first my mom wasnt sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch itbr br like i said this movie is every little boys dream the movie contains a terrific setting big muscled barbarians beautiful topless women big bad monsters and jokes youll only get when you get older so a couple of days ago i inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time at first i was bored then started thinking about how much i loved this movie when i was kid and continued watching yeah the experience wasnt as great as i remembered the acting is pretty bad the storyline is pretty bad the jokes werent funny anymore but the women were still pretty yes ive grown up even though the movie experience has changed for me i still think its worth 7 stars for the good old times you know
