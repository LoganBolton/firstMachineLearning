ive joined imdb so people know what a great film this is its not often you come across a film thats moving and visually cinematic yet humble youve read the plot so all i want to say is dont watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble because thats the typical misconception people read in toinstead just appreciate and realise its about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it this was one of the very few films to be nominated for a bafta being independent and foreign the beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the hollywood formula just a great story that will keep you engaged the only thing i wish is for it to be longer and see what happens
