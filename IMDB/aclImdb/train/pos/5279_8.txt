i wont repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this filmbr br in my opinion this is an excellent film not only as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and his grownup son but also as a little window onto the world of practising islam for those like me who are not very familiar with that religionbr br an important aspect of this story is that of the young mans relation to his fathers beliefs and practices and how his attitude towards the religion seems to alter in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with thembr br this is a very thoughtprovoking enjoyable and wellmade film that i would recommend to anyone with brain and heart
