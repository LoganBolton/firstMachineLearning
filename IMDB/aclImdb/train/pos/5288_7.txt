this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick k9 the green dogbr br this time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land capture an earth creature and take it back to mars of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny at first bugs thinks marvin and k9 are trick or treating but realises this cant be right when marvin drastically enlarges bugs rabbit hole with a raygun bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways including persuading marvin that k9 is planning a mutiny eventually he is captured using an acme straitjacket ejecting bazooka amazingly for an acme product it works as advertised and bugs is forced to use his wits to get k9 to release him the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are trussed up and bugs is trying to fly their saucer back to earthbr br i really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story marvins voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this didnt make me like him or the cartoon any less
