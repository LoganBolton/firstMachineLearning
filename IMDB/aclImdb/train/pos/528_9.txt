if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this isnt a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy  in fact youd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect  beauty and soul of powell and pressburgers masterpiece  the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today  again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made  raf bomber command lost 58000 men during the war  the same number that america lost in nam but during a shorter period and a far  far smaller pool of active combatants  theres no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if youd lost a relative during the conflict youd view material atheism as being a sensible thing  when richar attenboroughs young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didnt survive the war  also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 193945 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates  its obvious nazis dont go to heaven br br the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldnt have had much appeal to me if it wasnt for the subtext  you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as its replaced by american ambitions  theres little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture  one is the ethnic mix of america  even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51 of americans are  white european   the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess  i am an american  as peter is judged by abraham farlan  an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence  as for the  special relationship  between britain and america  what special relationship  powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america  they obviously know their future too br br so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present  its strange  beautiful  poignant and clever but most of all its a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years  can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq
