the best thing about this movie is that it is fun it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the blithe innocent pecker played appealingly by edward furlong who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life other great characters include peckers friend matt hes a thief but hes really a nice guy peckers sister chrissy who is addicted to sugar and peckers catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the virgin mary in her roombr br the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavyhanded about it there is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of common people of sliding into a kind of reverse holier than thou  but pecker avoids these traps allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subjectbr br i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun
