edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this moviebr br this is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really importantbr br pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and morebr br but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to herbr br well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standardsbr br to describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats itbr br oh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
