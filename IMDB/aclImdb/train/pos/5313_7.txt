as i am no fan of almost any postdesperate living john waters films i warmed to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trashlite versions of his earlier works cry baby polyester hairspray that to diehard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur pecker which doesnt attempt to regurgitate early successes is a slight quiet humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold at ridiculous prices some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldnt imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasnt emblazoned with the waters name edward furlong is fine as pecker and waters nonhistrionic style is at ease with the subject
