this movie was very very strange and very very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different too sort of dreamy and bleachedout which only added to the spacey fumbling weird vibe of the whole thingbr br its not for everyone i mean its not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it its unlike anything i have ever seen before    unpredictable with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy and pimply that you cant help but feel for them in other words these are far from hollywoodized versions of teenagersbr br all of which for me makes it a good thing
