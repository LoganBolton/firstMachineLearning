this is the second film ive seen of ida lupino as a director after 53s the hitchhiker i think this one was a better film then that one this one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesnt like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family i think leonard maltins review is right only to give it 2 and 12 stars
