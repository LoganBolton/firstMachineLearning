before this little blackandwhiter the touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the american screenthere were lots of these topics that hollywood and the production code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960s so its not surprising that it would take a little independent company like ida lupinos filmmakers to raise the subject the result is wellmeaning but somewhat compromised which is not surprising since director lupino had to work with code demands to get the movie releasedbr br interestingly ann waltons mala powers main problem following the assault is not how others might see her but how she sees herself and its a heavy load shes carrying will she ever be able to relate to men again will they look at her as spoiled goods after all this is 1950 small wonder she runs away rather than face these anxieties at home and at work even though family and friends are generally supportive overall this first part is earnest and welldone the chase is hyped to inject some action into the plot but then this is a movie notice how the incurious neighbor fails to respond to the honking horn near chases end had those been screams of alarm from powers instead the neighbors lack of response would have raised an interesting albeit complicating issuebr br the second half is pretty much given over to the production code in the sentimentalized person of rev ferguson tod andrews its he to quote a phrase who gives her courage to face life again theres some effort at humanizing him is it ann or her dilemma that hes most interested in still his gentle and understanding presence comes across as a little too miraculous and a little too hollywood fortunately the ending avoids the usual hollywood copout by emphasizing only the hope of a happy resolution for ann rather than its certainty br br give lupino a ton of credit for dealing with the topic in the first place given the overall results i expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to i also expect todays audiences find the treatment mildly interesting mainly because of powers excellent performance that brings out the purely human drama however the film works best now as a document of its time and what the cultural watchdogs of that day thought was appropriate for adult viewing
