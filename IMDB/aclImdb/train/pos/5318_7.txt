ida lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system not surprisingly she also tackled protofeminist themes that when touched at all were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about in outrage she treats rape and its aftermath and though throughout the short movie its referred to as criminal assault she leaves for once no doubt about what happenedbr br mala powers in her official debut plays a secretarybookkeeper at a big industrial plant she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy robert clarke who just got a raise and now makes 90 a week leaving the plant after working late one night she finds herself being stalked in the ensuing scene  the best in the movie  she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but failsbr br when she returns home disheveled and in shock the police cant get much out of her she claims she never saw her attacker who manned a snack truck outside the factory trying to pretend that nothing happened she returns to her job but falls apart thinking that everybody is staring at her judging her she goes into a fugue state running away to los angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop br br waking up in a strange ranch house she learns that shes been rescued by tod andrews a young minister in a california agricultural town she lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges the two fall vaguely in love but its clear to andrews that powers is keeping dire secrets when at a company picnic she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of jerry paris who was trying to steal a kiss the truth about her past comes outbr br it was a courageous movie to come out in 1950 and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental ending up talky and didactic yes lupino had important information to impart but she didnt trust the narrative to speak for itself her cast pleasant but bland and generic werent much help either reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance but outrage was a breakthrough blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is and what it really means to its victims
