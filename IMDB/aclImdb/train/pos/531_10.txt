this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made ive seen this movie for the first time a week ago since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleighs the pilgrimagebr br give me my scallopshell of quiet my staff of faith to walk upon my scrip of joy immortal diet my bottle of salvation my gown of glory hopes true gage and thus ill take my pilgrimage br br do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powells and emeric pressuburgers lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this moviebr br i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god i beg your pardon sir so do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime well well youll see weve written directed and produced i know where im going colonel blimp red shoes do you think that enough sir it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death the fact that other peoples lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this moviebr br of course oldtimers will be tempted to say they dont do movies like this one any more theyll be partially mistaken they didnt make movies like this in the past times eitherbr br ive have already quoted keats here but ill repeat his words a thing of beauty is a joy forever
