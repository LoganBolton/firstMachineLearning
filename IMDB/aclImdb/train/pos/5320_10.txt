i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first twenty minutes the artwork and main character who is enigmatic doesnt talk much really got me in this moviebr br i really liked this movie it was dark beautifully acted and really touching its a bit slow but the immersion was complete the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes the ending was unexpected with a twist i didnt see coming its not the kind of movie we see often
