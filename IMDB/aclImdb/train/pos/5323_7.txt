there are a number of things that are not correct although this is not too important since what happened to whom and when is still in dispute the most blatant liberty with the facts i think is when they start to play at bruno koschmidders kaiserkeller when in fact they played at the indra and moved to the kaiserkeller laterbr br i agree with semprinni20 that the film was biased in favour of pete bests version but if he is the story consultant then i guess he calls the shots i also agree with semprinni that the recordings pete best plays on say the last word on the subject of why he was firedbr br although the film is not such a lavish production as the later film backbeat i prefer this film because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characterisationbr br there is plenty in the film that is quite substantial  such as brian epstein trying to hide the fact that he has been queerbashed only to find out that the band knew he was gay all along little touches like the band going into a caf√© and ordering cornflakes mit milch my favourite scene which does have some bassis in fact is where at an audition stuart sutcliffe has just bought his bass guitar but cant play it so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries faking it but gets caught thats rock n rollbr br well worth watching
