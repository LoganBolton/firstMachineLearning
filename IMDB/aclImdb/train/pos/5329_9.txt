this film was greatbr br the plot was preposterousbr br the action sequences contrivedbr br but provided you can lighten up enough to laugh it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone rangerbr br the baddies were more silly than bad the good guys werent too good the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypesbr br the inclusion of a baby added a good touch sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise br br i have to disagree about the acting it was on the whole very good i really wanted to punch judge reinholdbr br and after all isnt that the mark of a really good movie wanting to punch judge reinhold
