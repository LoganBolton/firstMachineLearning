in light of bad reviews  or car crashes  i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due and do a service im not sure people have license to say it was so bad almost automaticallybr br its rare for a movie to have suspense this movie maintained suspense its whole length for me despite any flaws that may be how many films can say that not even many big ones because of the simple premise you dont know if the people will get out of the lifethreatening situation which lasts the whole movie yeh the suspension was tight and over some bumps the shocks did their work its not just a tv movie but an allaction movie there is no point where it stops or deviates or becomes talky it would be hard to make a film like this always on the road only duel or speed are this that i recall the best thing in them also was the constant tensionbr br acting is not bad the judge is as good as ever and the others are br br script is good but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be  or seem to be  a little awry what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so your first judgments are not always right but i think the lead actors was right in being in this moviebr br stunts are mostly terrific especially for a tv movie their only failing may be the noticeable and again apparent slow speed but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can lookbr br i liked that the beginning said inspired by a true story so you are not going to go how much is true you know just the basis is the usual based on a true story makes me think it should mostly be true but maybe thats my errorbr br how to save them good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up just a few inches would do a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph odd that they didnt call a car expert  or auto electrician or mechanic  to see if theres a waybr br i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster or at least neutral and help it become a runaway successbr br pic quality is a little soft for a dvdbr br spoiler they would have been winched out after the baby was but strangely that lifesaving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out i guess we know why end of movie suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby
