if im going to watch a porn movie i prefer it to have some sort of plot and a descent dialogue behind bedroom doors is one of the few ive come across with those attributesbr br the new girl next door scams on the neighbors human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned chelsea bluei mean brooke lavelle is the choice actress to play the part of the blackmailing seductress and plays the part magnificently chelsea blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress the movie gets an overall 10 just because she is in it her partner in the movie monique alexander is a definite cutie the two should do more work together in this movie though monique who plays gigi doesnt have a whole lot to do or say thats too bad she seems like she has more talent to be shared i like the girl who was the possible das wife next i forget her name but shes pretty good looking and not a bad actress nicole sheridanim still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about its obvious there are parts of her bought an paid for which is okay but is she finished sorry but come on im afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating some except chelseas talent and beauty overrides any negatives overall this movie is a good one
