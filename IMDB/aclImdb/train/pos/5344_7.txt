this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought being a history teacher i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the filmbr br the movie begins with 12 yearold carol and her mother returning to her mothers home town years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city despite the strangeness carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts as for why her and her mother are alone ill spill it now for those who dont pick up on the fact that carols father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans who eventually lost in this very bloody conflictbr br the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music the rather slow and rambling pace isnt bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to themnot better or worsejust a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flickbr br psif you dont know which side is which the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries including the usa the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy
