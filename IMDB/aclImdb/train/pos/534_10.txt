the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness  the altered version of the archers logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos its strange to think that its a wonderful life came out in the same year no great coincidence the 1940s was awash with heavenandearth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junges visionbr br it continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us im not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other not so here powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if its the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their ownbr br as for the story  this may be pressburgers best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events other than that its tight yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary or both perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was as it so happened true everyone says were meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i dont see why im sure we are meant to ask the question the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is  indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesnt mean that this shouldnt occupy us as well there is as ive said before a lot going onbr br consider the scene in which abraham farlan heavens prosecuting lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says the voice of england 1945 dr reeves the defence acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though hes got a lemon in his mouth reeves looks smugbr br snobbery well i dont see why its snobbish to condemn blues music  and thats not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home they dont find it incomprehensible theres something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is reeves probably realises as much all english audiences and all australian indian etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to farlan  hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else its a clever scenebr br one last thing i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career but even so i dont think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did
