i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didnt know about this website and i didnt realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show for me this is a pleasant surprise because i cant tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt the episode where starsky kill starsky almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show what to you expect of a kid at age 12 now i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on im so there just got to say happy birthday paul
