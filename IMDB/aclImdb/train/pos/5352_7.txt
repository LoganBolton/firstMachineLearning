this is an arnold movie now that you know that ive saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review if you dont like arnold then you wont like this movie if the case is the other then you will very probably like it its as simple as thatbr br now if youre still reading this i expect you like arnold good for you he is quite good isnt he the running man is a very typical arnold feature its got the usual retrofuture we know so well from 80s bsci fi its got a bunch of terrible oneliners lots of violence and explosions and a goodlooking heroine and a happy endingbr br in this case the evil opponent is the allcontrolling 1984ish government which uses television as an effective crowdcontrol with gladiatortype game shows arnold of course ends up in one of these shows and turns it all upsidedown with a little help from his two confederates and the goodlooking amberbr br its not a big budget movie but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it its hopelessly 80s but i find that charming acting is varying arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing with a helping of stonefaced oneliners heroine amber is to put it lightly a bit stereotypical and the subtly named damen killian is a typical evil tv manbr br in spite of all its flaws the movie shows its message very clearly television is an opiate of the masses a good way to control people it also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience this does not seem futuristic at all today which is a bit alarmingbr br if youve seen arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one enjoy
