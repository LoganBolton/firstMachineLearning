amongst the standard one liner type action films where acting and logic are checked at the door this movie is at the top of the class if the person in charge of casting were to have put good actors in this flick it would have been worseexcepting richard dawson who actually did act well if you can call playing yourself acting i love this movie the running man is in all likelihood gods gift to manokay maybe just men definitely the most quotable movie of our time so ill part you with my favorite line its all part of lifes rich pattern brenda and you better fg get used to it ahh more people have been called brenda for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine
