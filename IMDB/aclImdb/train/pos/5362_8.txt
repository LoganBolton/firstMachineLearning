the running man along with total recall is my favorite schwarzenegger movie no this isnt 2001 but its not meant to be and the acting and script here isnt even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen a statesponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against heroic stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons the runners are equipped with none in order to satisfy the publics lust for sport and blood the ultimate prize for a winning runner freedom or so the rules claimbr br for a movie with such overthetop gory death scenes and cheesy oneliners it really does have a lot to say someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culturegovernment presented in this movie so i wont go into it here suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie you will enjoy it very much especially if youre a big sf fan with a lot of imagination like i said its not trying to be a serious art film but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shootemup flick the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman aka stephen king short novel but diverges fairly strongly from its source material especially towards the end the book ends rather nihilistically needless to say this movie doesnt i enjoyed both but i like the movie betterbr br my favorite line guess its caused from steroids
