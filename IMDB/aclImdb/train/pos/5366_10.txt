im sitting here nov 2006 and i still cant help rave about this movie arnolds best movies came in about a 45 year span running man predator and total recall 1990 all 3 are amazing the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017 but you cant help but snicker at the 80s style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtvs also the computer graphics of the the running man game show intro would not look like that in 2017 nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with todays movies i really think that arnolds acting is much better than hes given credit for now i would not have elected him governor but thats california for you buzzsaw dynamo fireball subzero are fantastic stalkers as well and i find the producers dont try to overkill the fight scenes when the stalker is deadhes dead it doesnt go on for 20 minutes each the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they dont try and overplay it i give this movie a 1010 and thats coming from someone who doesnt enjoy a lot of movies these days if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that youd see in 2006 are not important or necessary
