of all arnolds mid80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad it may have been farfetched back then but not so now not when you think about it currently reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar if the next one isnt more controversial as the last its a dud how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man how long before we have courtappointed theatrical attorneys or the entertainment division of the justice department there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv showsbr br the biggest message of all is you are being lied to its no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe its a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future its no secret that reality tv is not very realistic its edited and reshaped before being aired and its only what the networks want you to see usually its far from the real truthbr br although rather different than stephen kings book the ending is completely changed the script does conform to the typical arnie formula yes he does have numerous and very corny oneliners and he does say ill be back which he never really said that often anyway when you think about it in the most ironic situation yet but hes still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been these two were considered before arnie believe it or notbr br the director is none other than dave starsky himself paul michael glaser it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look andrew davis not a director i particularly like was attached before glaser though no matter who directs the film is still marred by a very heavy 80s feelbr br first of all harold faltermeyers score remember him is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future apart from the dated feel the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shootout that passes as the climaxbr br this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release gone is the horrid letterbox picture in its place is a brand new hidefinition 1851 anamorphic transfer the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen the new dolby 51 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful definitely one of the best remasters ive seen so far two intriguing documentaries a trailer and a meet the stalkers gimmick are included in this 2disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case
