i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago then the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional if indeed they could ever transpire at all not any longer now the politics society and media in the running man seem very close to home indeedbr br consider the following factors which were mostly absent in 1987 the year the running man came out that are present todaybr br concern with as richard dawsons character damon killian puts it traditional morality checkbr br entertainment in the form of extreme reality including pain fear and discomfort on the part of contestants checkbr br cameras everywhere checkbr br restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports travel passes in the movie and sanctioned under the guise of national security checkbr br an increased intermingling bordering on incestuous of government and media checkbr br computergenerated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage such as the digital matting of ben richards image onto the stunt double checkbr br jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration checkbr br flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and notsowealthy increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent check check checkbr br then again maybe its just a movie based on a stephen king novella but just to be safe im moving to switzerland
