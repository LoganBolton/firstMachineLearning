perhaps not the absolute greatest entry in the hammer house of horror series but it surely wins the award for most inventively titled episode the house that bled to deathÂ… i could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it and besides the wondrous title this short movie also benefices from a solidly written screenplay and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments it might require an extra viewing before you fully understand the peculiar endtwist but its definitely an original idea for a horror short the story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middleclass house the husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later the cursed house is still for sale a young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and start to restore it but mysterious events occur and affect especially the young sophie her beloved cat is killed an even her birthday party gets ruined when one of the houses pipes suddenly sprays blood all over the guests a particularly chilling sequence this one is the old house really haunted or maybe the seemly helpful neighbors cause all the horror the answers to these questions are provided in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and theres even room for a real shock at the very end the tension is masterfully built up and the titular house is filled with eerie scenery like the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to slay his wife little warning though the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when youre an animal lover in conclusion another winner for hammers shortrunning tv series
