the college girl murders is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace  and generally my first real acquaintance with krimi films in general  and i can say that im moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so  goofy the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings theres some james bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor  recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison theres also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist kkk member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i dont care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky 60s soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time its like a variant on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements
