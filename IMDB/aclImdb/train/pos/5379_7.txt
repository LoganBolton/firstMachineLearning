theres a lot going on in the college girl murders a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas before he can reap the rewards of his discovery the scientist is killed by a hooded whipwelding monk after a coed is killed in a church by the gas scotland yard is called in to investigate but the killing continues who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college br br what works br br  the killer whats not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit complete with red gloves the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown although the idea of a killer in a flaming red pointyhead outfit sneaking around a girls school is fairly farfetched its one of the more sinister looking costumes ive seenbr br  groovy 60s music i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders its got a jazzy hip 60s feel to it that i just lovedbr br  bizarre touches beyond the killers red gown and hood the movie features a sliding fireplace a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead poison spraying bibles a strategically placed mannequin miniskirts gogo boots and mile high hair i would describe it as a cross between the 60s batman tv show and an italian giallo the college girl murders is a real treat for the eyebr br  the end lets just say that there are more twists than a mountain road just when you think the killer has been uncovered here comes a twistand anotherand anotherand anotherbr br what doesnt work br br  chief inspector sir john i know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his buffoonish character has way too much screen timebr br  why have alligators previously i mentioned the alligators in the pit and while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose why go through all the trouble and not use them br br  plodding plot some of the college girl murders has no flow or rhythm to it there are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable moviebr br i havent seen many of these german krimis but of the few i have seen phantom of soho strangler of blackmoor castle dead eyes of london this may be my favorite this one has a real funky feel to it that i really go into had the plot flowed a little better i could have easily given the college girl murders a 710
