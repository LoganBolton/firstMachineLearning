this is probably the fastestpaced and most actionpacked of the german edgar wallace krimi series a cross between the dr mabuse films of yore and 60s pop thrillers like batman and the man from uncle it reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monks habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip set at a posh girls school filled with lecherous middleaged professors and with the cops fondling their hottotrot secretaries at every opportunity it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politicallyincorrect times theres a definite link to a later wallacebased film the excellent giallo whatever happened to solange which also concerns female students being corrupted by and corrupting their elders quite appropriate to the monk theme the mastermind villain uses boobytrapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows and also maintains a reptilereplete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences br br alfred vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show the monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip while appearing against purplishnight backgrounds theres also a voyeurfriendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes the trademark kicker of hiding the ende card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here and theres a fine brassy and twangy score for retromusic fansbr br fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant eddie arent character in these later films instead the chief inspector sir john takes on the role of buffoon convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses unfortunately klaus kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things the krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point and now worked on a much more blatant popculture level which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers
