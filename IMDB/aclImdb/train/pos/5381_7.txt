for a low budget movie this was really good i put this well above your average action bmovie sean and corinne delivered in this movie and they didnt seem camera shy watch out for the cameos of jeanne and jared i didnt think that the producers would even consider that but the runnerups deserve that much br br ill be looking forward to more of sean and corinnes involvement in the movie entertainment industry seans character seemed very genuine and sexy corinnes character was pretty hardnosed and on point she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch the chemistry between zane and seans character was pretty good the action sequences werent cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie of course there were flaws but that comes with the territory br br overall this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv sean and corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game i hope that jeanne jared and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their costars in entertainment successbr br final judgment
