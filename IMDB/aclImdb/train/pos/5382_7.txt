after watching the next action star reality tv series i was pleased to see the winners movie right away i was leery of such a showcase of new talent but i was pleasantly surprised and thrilled billy zane of course was his usual great self but corinne and sean held their own beside him it was also nice to see jared and jeanne also from the competition in their cameo roles seans character not billys is the hunted and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played corinne walks the tightrope well between her character liking seans and only being in it for the money i loved how the game was played right to the last second and then beyond not a great movie but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate
