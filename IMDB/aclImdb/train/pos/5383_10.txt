i thought this movie was excellentfor the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the businessit was packed with action and a little romancebut there were some points when corrine didnt speak very clearly when she threatened sean with the gun and she clenched her teethmaybe she was supposed toi think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very welland there was an obvious contrastalsobecause i watched next action stari am certain that corrine and sean did their own stuntswhich were performed very welli am looking forward to another movie by the pairas they make a great teamor perhaps a sequel to bet your lifepossibly called making it big in the big appleit could this time be about carmenbet your life is excellent
