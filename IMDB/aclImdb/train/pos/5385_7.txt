i never watched the next action hero show and until reading the other comments here did not know that this movie was the prize from that competition i was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself watching dare eagerly all the way to the endbr br yes the plots been done the most dangerous game etc but i was hoping for and almost received the gotcha  how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end i think the hightech was overdone gpss and gave me coldsweat flashbacks of night rider but it nevertheless was not too overdonebr br the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod suspension of disbelief that was required of the viewer do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up pleeease way too much of that type of thing  fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very muchbr br the final solution was good but the ending was disappointing with the after taste of a bad star trek episode at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy  except for zane who doesnt get near as much work as he deserves imho  they were winners from a reality showbr br knock me out
