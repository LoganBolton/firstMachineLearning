this film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldnt work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived however if you are the sort person like me who adores older hollywood films you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it isan interesting soapbr br the film is set in a ward for problem pregnancies in this large room are about a half dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birthbut doctors are concerned about possible complications yikessuch a room would really traumatize the mothers and like an episode of love boat or fantasy island each mother has her own special story with so many rather extreme and crazy stories you have to suspend disbelief i could and enjoyed the film quite a bitbr br here are a few of the stories one involves a father you dont see the mom but he is a very very nervous father and its included for comic relief however he was wonderful herevery touchingbr br loretta young and eric linden are a sad case loretta is sent to the hospital from prisonshe apparently killed some horrible guy you dont know exactly what occurred but you assume he was trying to force himself on her yet she was given a 20 year sentenceand her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he canbr br glenda farrell is an awful person she has the maternal instincts of a hamstera really really bad and alcoholic hamster she is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as becoming upset when she learns she cant make money selling her twins late in the film she has a typical hollywoodstyle change of heart that was supposed to be touchingi found it contrivedbr br there is a woman who has given birth to a stillborn baby amazingly afterwords they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth a crazy woman who you assumed lost a baby some time agowanders down from the psychiatric unit she insists shes having a baby later she escapes again and actually takes one of the kidsbr br there are most stories than this but the ones i mentioned are the main ones as i said its a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertainingand quite sad in the case of several of the stories the ending in particular is heartbreaking and exceptionally well done there were a few particularly good performancesespecially farrell and aline macmahon as the head nurse all in all a very good filmand i have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later which was typical for warner brothers
