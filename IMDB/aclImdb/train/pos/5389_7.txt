sort of like a very primitive episode of general hospital set in a natal ward and one for tough cases at that this fastmoving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact  mainly because eric linden as the distraught young husband in the main plot is so palpably a wreck and with such good reason his expectant wife loretta young is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him ms young as always doesnt do anything to disinvite audience sympathy and shes a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie and the outcome  not an entirely happy one  feels right aline macmahon one of the cinemas few perfect actresses in the apt words of film historian david thomson exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse and glenda farrell as a nonetoowilling new mom of twins gets to croon frankie and johnny as a drunken lullaby frank mchugh figures in another subplot and he gets to show more range than warners usually permitted him its scaled and paced modestly and lindens expectantdad panic stays with you for days  this sort of part was often played for laughs but hes a terrified young kid in trouble and very persuasive
