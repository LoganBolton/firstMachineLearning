life begins  and ends  in a typical 1930s maternity  recovery ward where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers i found the film fascinating and exceptionally movingbr br oddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton graces loretta young husband what an actor as a first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly id like to see more of this actors work he had a very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed dont cut dont cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical professionbr br loretta young did another superb acting job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes ive really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few monthsbr br glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the endbr br also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as a grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notablebr br life begins is a mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into 9 out of 10
