simple meaningful and delivers an emotional punch i regularly trail through dull short films and its always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message without pretensions or self indulgent directingbr br a boy at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays truant and is given the most important lesson of his life only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around he has to share with the school bullybr br unlike most short films featuring children or actors these kids hold their own and its believable the soundtrack nicely complements the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well
