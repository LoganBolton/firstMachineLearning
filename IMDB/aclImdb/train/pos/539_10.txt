the first was good and original i was a not bad horrorcomedy movie so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch itbr br what really makes this movie work is judd nelsons character and the sometimes clever script a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay sometimes theres scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainylookbr br great madefortv movie it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelsons stanley doing what he does bestbr br i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so youll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background
