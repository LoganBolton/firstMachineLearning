hitokiri which translates roughly as assassination aka tenchu which translates roughly as divine punishment showcases hideo gosha at the top of his form do not miss this one or goshas other classic goyokin hitokiri is not only one of goshas best films its one of the best samuraichambara films ever made and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever exportedbr br be warned all of the intricate plot details in hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century japanese history even so the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers as per the norm for gosha hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of loyalty to ones lord vs doing the right thing however gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication that its really the movie to see along with goyokin of coursebr br i suppose it breaks down like this if you want a simpler more actionoriented tale you might want to see goyokin however if you want a more thoughtful multilayered albeit grim drama see this onebr br ok ok essentially the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either 1 working to reform yet retain the tokugawa shogunate and 2 those who are trying to install the emperor meiji as the supreme ruler of japan of course those clans working for emperor meiji were often less interested in reforming japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the new world order ironically the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the meiji government its ironic twists like this  goshas big on irony  that make the entire plot all the more bittersweetbr br what distinguishes hitokiri from goshas other movies is goshas mature sense of cinematography every shot is thoughtfully composed and much like kubricks barry lyndon each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition of course this is typical gosha hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops includingas with goyokin many riveting seascapes just watch the opening sequence and youre hooked make no mistake this is no english period piece hitokiri is extremely violent dont say you werent warnedbr br what else other than cool camera work makes hitokiri stand out the performances seem to me a bit more subtle in this one katsu shintaro of zatoichihanzo the razor fame turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonistantihero okada izo katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain throughout the movie youre never quite sure if youre engaged or revolted by okadas character at the same time katsus portrayal of okadas ravenous hunger for respect and his later pathetic attempts at redemption seem so human that you cant help but feel empathysympathy of course after seeing nakadai tatsuya play the tortured hero in goyokin its great to see him play such a ruthless villain in hitokiri hes just perfect theres nothing more to saybr br as a final note perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans dont miss the last screen appearance of mishima yukio yes the closeted gay rightwing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering japanese military personnel he kidnapped in 1970 and had a movie on his life and work made by paul schrader who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable for an assassin shinbei tanaka
