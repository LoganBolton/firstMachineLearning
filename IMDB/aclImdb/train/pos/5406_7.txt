the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died dont you dare say that pokemon sucks i dont like it when people say that ive liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years so everyone should enjoy pokemon including this movie and other pokemon movies so without further ado please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages and also why do pokemonhaters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies i dont understand they shouldnt do that theres absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that 1 pokemon is for little kids only 2 pokemon is stupid and 3 people shouldnt like pokemon i think this is why people dont like pokemon
