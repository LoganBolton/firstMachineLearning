actually that video camera effect is just that its an effect a rather good one u dont know much about directing a film do you this film is in fact better than the original its great fun to watch made for tv doesnt need to follow any rules i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film judd is one of the scariest villains ever and hes more realistic he doesnt just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors
