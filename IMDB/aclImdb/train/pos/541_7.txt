as a sequelthis is not a bad moviei actually liked it better than the 1st onei found it more entertainingit seemed like it was shot documentary styleat first this bothered meas i thought it just looked too low budgetbut it grew on meand it made the movie seem more authenticthis movie has more dry one liners than the originalwhich is a good thingin my opinioni do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the charactersit almost becomes a parody of itselfwhich may be the pointthis movie at least has some suspensewhich the 1st one did not havein my viewit has some of the same great music from the originalwhich is greatthe acting again was pretty decent for the most partthough like i saidsome of it seemed over the topi also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just dont seem to flowlike the rest of the movieoverallthoughi thought this was a pretty sequelmy rating for return to cabin by the lake is 710
