this and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap operawas the greatest epic to come out of hollywoods greatest year 1939i will not not restate the obviouscary grantvictor mclaglen who was a bengal lancer and douglas fairbanks jr give superb comic performanceshowever i want to note two other less understood elements of this masterpiece the magnificent final battle sequence as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment is simply grand it never fails to enthrall me yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannellis performance as the guru this is no fu manchu caricature but an well drawn articulate historically informed  have you ever heard of changruputra mauryahe defeated the armies left in india by alexander the greatvillain indeed one can see parallels between this mystical evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties a german not an indian gunga din antinazi tract not quite but still a tremendous funny moving epic
