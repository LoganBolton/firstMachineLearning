my favorite imperialism movie and one of the best actionadventure flicks of all time grant mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daringdo and wise cracks to please all but the most pc of film goers memorable scenes abound  the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs macchesney  cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch save some for the elephant cutter to macchesney  im an expedition din breaking cutter out of jail with a fork what do you think im trying to break out of a bleedin pudding and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing bold as brass  all right youre all under arrestbr br i could go on but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on for armchair adventurers and generals its hard to imagine a better 2 hours
