i did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroismbravery and the honor to have served in her majestys servicethis film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should behowever i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgtcutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee groupbr br to be certain sgt cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her majesty the queen of englandi think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was greata reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know feari think grant was excellent in this roletruly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he worei never felt ballantine was a shoein in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picturewhat do i meanthis picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attentionboth ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majestythese three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a usefuleven enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it interveneis it believablei dont knowi think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the serviceand getting married and going into the tea businessmachesney says he could sign up for another 9 yearsit will make a man out of himi like that sentimentbr br i dont think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interestswhere does this endin fact it may never endthose interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years oldi had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kalithere is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kalithis motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligencethis is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attemptedi think this is an excellent filmgeorge stevens directedbr br there is a few items to be aware of i dont think all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mrkipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kiplinggeorge stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurredthe information is honestcompelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga dinthere is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warnedsgtcutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restraineddin having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending perilwith a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee templethe sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarneda very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullifiedit is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now showssgtcutter says good work soldieri dont know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending perilbr br the end is far from being anticlimaticit is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificedballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate timethe colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defensemachesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medalthis is a very sober point and then he comes to dinnow here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored deadthe poem is read as though it was just penned by kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the mengunga din bravo
