when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie i wanted to watch it took me weeks to realize that ive seen the original of this and loved it so i had even more reason to watch well i watched it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies i hate what happens to brians character you can find out for yourself and i didnt like most of the characters brians one included but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerklike characters to make stanley caldwell judd nelson shine once more at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood id suggest you watch this
