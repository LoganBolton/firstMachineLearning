this movie is one of my all time favorites cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jrwhat a cast not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din drama action adventure and comedy all rolled up into one the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears if you havent seen it id strongly recommend it
