id love to give this movie a 1010 but in its existing state i can only go to 810 tops the postcode editing read destroying of this film warrants a 2point demeritbr br from my very limited knowledge of film history baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camels back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the production code into play in 1934 i dont know what the other movie was as a result the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be rereleased after 1934 it was chopped and edited to bits and no original version is known to exist today the best that we can see today is the version that tcm turner classic movies shows but that is blatantly edited in several scenes and has a really disappointing happy ending slapped onto the endbr br all the above being said the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch barbara stanwyck is as always absolutely amazing and wonderful she is so beautiful and powerful she just owns the whole movie she plays a woman whos been used by men her entire life starting with her father who pimps her out to the local erie pa steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of if you dont shut down my speakeasy ill let you sleep with my daughter when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick the smile on stanwycks face is pricelessbr br after the fire stanwyck leaves erie with her maid and heads to new york city she sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top starting out with the personnel clerk in the hr department she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank from there she sleeps with man after man after man including a very young john wayne using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale manipulating shevixen in this flick if you watch this movie i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character courtland trenholm die in stanwycks arms skip the remaining 3 minutes or so the happy ending slapped on to the end of the movie for postcode audiences is insulting to the audiences intelligence and lame beyond belief the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about mr and mrs trenholms million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in erie with former vp trenholm now working in the steel mills  cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie  the end puhleeze  how lame the movie originally ended with george brent succeeding in his suicide attempt i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on postcode endingbr br i certainly hope that a print of the original precode version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime update the original has been found and should be out on dvd andor tcm in 2006 until then ill enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lameo postcode ending
