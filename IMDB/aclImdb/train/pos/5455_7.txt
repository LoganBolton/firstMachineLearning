infamous precode film really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquorselling father has no problem pimping her out to customers when he dies in an accident shes released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder one bed at a time although obviously theres no actual sex shown the film is quite sleazy unfortunately after the initial shock value fades around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through as always shes fantastic
