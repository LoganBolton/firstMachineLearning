baby face is a fast paced wise cracking knowing smirk of a film thatbr br lasts only an hour and 15 minutes but oh what a smart 75 minutes theybr br are that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such abr br short time puts most of todays movie makers to shame screenwriters ofbr br today should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat thatbr br overwhelms so many of their films br br the story is no nonsense an amoral woman rises to wealth first underbr br and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with herbr br sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming happy endingbr br but it isnt hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted tobr br go so enjoy whats there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as abr br hapless suitor not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one ifbr br youve never seen baby face catch it the next time its shown on cablebr br or rent the cassette its worth the effort
