sequels hardly ever live up to the original this definitely proves true in this case however if youre a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch although the camera work is lacking brian krauses character is annoying and the plot is clique its much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it br br dont see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film quite frankly its a bit different rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project cabin by the lake this movie has a much different feel but its still great to see stanley back in actionbr br im giving it a 6 out of 10
