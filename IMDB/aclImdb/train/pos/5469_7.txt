the prerelease version of 1933s baby face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment mentored by a nietszchean professor lily powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her fathers speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except lilys childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father the destructive relationship with her father suggests lilys hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate while lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors perhaps the bank failures in the 1930s owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious womenbr br the plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as lily climbs ever higher barbara stanwyck reveled in tough hardbitten roles and she is in top form here sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung only her africanamerican confidante chico receives lilys affection trust and loyalty in more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of theresa harris who plays chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her stanwyck often appears overly madeup and stiffly coiffed in comparison to harris however despite stanwycks tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including douglass dumbrille donald cook and a young john waynebr br the preferred version of baby face is the 76minute restored cut the edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit perhaps darryl zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from nietszche whose views on women were controversial however despite alphonse ethiers lectures and advice not to be defeated by life lilys grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor however the philosophy is but a distraction short fast paced and entertaining baby face is as contemporary in its morality as wall street substitute gordon gecko for nietszche and lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good
