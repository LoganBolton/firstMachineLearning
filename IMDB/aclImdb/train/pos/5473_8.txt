this one is considered a key precode film  from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story 1946 but also the paranoid scifi invasion usa 1952  and features one of barbara stanwycks best early rolesbr br shes supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  george brent douglass dumbrille edward van sloan nat pendleton and john wayne at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter robert barrat as stanwycks father donald cook as her most tragic conquest alphonse ethier as her elderly mentor  more on this later arthur hohl as a lecherous politician and henry kolker as cooks boss and fatherinlaw whom stanwyck also seduces curiously scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censorsbr br abetted by crackling ie typically hardboiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our smalltown heroine by the intellectual ethier stanwyck complains to him early on that shes no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy  directed by howard hawks and costarring gary cooper  of that name under ethiers auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm shes eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesmans lust for power  in sergei eisensteins october 1927 sociologically its also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maidcompanionbr br the first twothirds of the film are simply terrific at first i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedlyintroduced george brent character while he ignores herbut just like the others hes soon under her spell on second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring  as its evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hardearned wealth for as long as its possiblebr br released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed prerelease version and the tamer theatrical release print among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwycks life as a tramp from the age of 14 though its heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been shortened ie censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only brent appears in the version released to theaters etc tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tackedon happy ending the prerelease version concludes abruptly on a very effective openended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which basically has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche
