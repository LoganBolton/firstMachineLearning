i dont know if im just weird but i thoroughly enjoyed this film br br return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake in fact i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one i also thought that the cast in this movie was great judd nelson is always the best i also enjoyed the plot as a whole i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanleys screenplay cabin by the lake it wasnt a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them  if youre looking for some deep meaning then this film is probably not the one for you however if youre looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it ive probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film
