this is a great movie it shows what our government will to to other countries if we dont like their government this isnt as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this this movies also proves that american media spouts government propaganda this is exactly what they did to aristide in haiti the reason this coup against chavez didnt succeed is chavez was elected with over 90 of the votebr br this movie isnt just a political documentary it would still be a great movie if it were a drama its amazing that this is realbr br the other reviewer is lying when he says chavez seizes the airwaves the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time
