ive been impressed with chavezs stance against globalisation for sometime now but it wasnt until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved this film tells the story of coupconspiracy by venezuelas elite the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments to remove democratically elected president chavez and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of world  i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime
