its really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official truth and caught so many news agencies with their pants down this movie in my view deserves every price there is in journalism  its objective yes courageous and a real scoop it can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions  everyone including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words the filmmakers only had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rollingbr br the venezuelan elite teaches us how to depose of a president and sell it as a victory of democracy its amazing that they lost in the end  so far from what i know the biggest tv station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked theyre still broadcasting via cable and satellite i highly doubt whether george w or barack obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup but then they dont have to worrybr br the fact that the chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the socalled free established media really has become or has always been only more so an important lesson to anyone interested in what really goes on in the worldbr br the famous objectivity challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse us  it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb the us secret history of spreading democracy around the world or the iraq war that according to johns hopkins has killed 13 million iraquis by now not to mention the 60000 afghans in 2003 that are never mentioned to be objective saddam hussein was less damaging to his people than the us and the us is ready  willing to be more damaging to the iranians that he wasbr br im quite curious about the upcoming trial of some khmer rouge leaders before the international tribunal in the hague whether there will be any mention of our involvement in supporting and training pol pots guerrillas in the 80s when they had been largely defeated by the vietnamese probably notbr br all the more reason to turn to the independent media for balance if not exposure of fraud
