a remarkable piece of documentary giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself for further evidence check out some of the comments on imdb compares extremely favourably with oliver stones comandante which is mainly an indepth examination of fidel castros nostril hairs i dont know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being or yet another in the long line of populist latinamerican caudillos nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans its hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions  but ive certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of whats at stake and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup someone says in the film were making history and thats exactly what the film feels like its capturing outstanding stuff
