im going to review the 2 films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered and watched when i talk about the film i am talking about parts 1  2 together when watched one after the other as they should bebr br thank you jon anderson steven soderbergh  benicio del torobr br this film is a refreshing bold gritty and true film and it hearkens a new style of film making no faux drama no swelling sound track not faux documentary style just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts i have been reading jon andersons che guevara a revolutionary life and recently finished fidels auto biography and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly but i have to say that it is jon andersons exhaustive penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone anderson was consultant on this film or these 2 films what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean no swelling music or slowmotion photography to heighten drama and even more importantly no fake documentary shaky camera just square shots and straight forward shooting style the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle benicio del toro should be given full honors for this i never doubted him as che throughout the film not once he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film it doesnt try to be everything it doesnt try to tell the story a persons life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2 4 8 16 or 32 hours this is one of the subtle beauties of this film it resists that temptation and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him it focuses on 3 slices of time the battle to over throw batista ches un speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia motorcycle diaries already told his young man side and i applaud s soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead i keep referring to jon andersons book and the film stays true the only weak link for me are the casting not the performance of matt damon in a film so loaded with true to life performances an american matt damon playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch  he does well but after so much care in the casting this was an oversite small and completely forgiven the reality that the rest of the casting gives you and most notably benicio del toros amazing job puts this film at the top of my listbr br the fact that this film went almost straight to video says something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the revolutionized cuba to become what it might have are still at work keeping its story quiet if not out of clandestine muffling then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topicbr br this is a must see film and jon andersons che guevara a revolutionary life is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international  political financial chess moves of the 40s 50s  60s that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors and the effects it fostered
