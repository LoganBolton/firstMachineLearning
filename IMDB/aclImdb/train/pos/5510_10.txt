possibly the most brilliant thing about che part two as we begin to integrate it with part one in our minds is that there is no clarification of why che chose to confidentially abscond from cuba after the revolution no allusion to his experience in the congo no clarification of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup detat no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across south america which walter salles has given prominent familiarity extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships he is reasonably unreasonable che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men it is the conceptbr br in part 1 in cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages given food and cover supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution here in bolivia not much understanding is apparent villagers expose him they protect government troops not his own when he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system his audience appears uninterested you cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply soderbergh shows us military advisers working with the bolivians but doesnt fault the united states for ches collapse che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have itbr br in showcasing both wars soderbergh doesnt build his battle scenes as actions with specific results ches men attack and are attacked they exchange fire with faraway assailants there is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat its death toll not paused for this is not a war movie it is about one mans reasonably unreasonable drive to endure there is no elaborate cinematography soderbergh looks firmly at ches inflexible dedication there are remarkable sporadic visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as ches pov shot during his final beats there is an abundance of the terrain where these men live for weeks at a time and the allconsuming effect is of languor guevara himself having malaria part of the timebr br benicio del toro one of the films producers gives a champions performance not least because its modest he isnt portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes in cuba he arises in conquest in bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude you may think the film is too long i think theres a genuine cause for its breadth guevaras affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane in the end che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means
