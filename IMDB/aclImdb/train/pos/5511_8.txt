part ii or formerly known as guerilla is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara once again im impressed by the causeandeffect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories were reminded again and again that the lead character che guevara is an argentine some of the men in fidels army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia he doesnt get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because hes a foreignerbr br as far as technical goes i think part ii wouldve been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what hes set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they dont work in bolivia it is clear now in this segment that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro in bolivia hes dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it its said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love well they dont give a damn that much about their country so its a tough sell its excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his visionbr br i like one particular scene that illustrates ches deteriorating condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets hes a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier whos stabs his own horse his army is like a horse that doesnt want to be led but at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that youll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another but maybe that is the intention of part ii if so then it definitely works standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of ches last breath this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling
