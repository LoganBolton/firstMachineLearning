ive read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general now i dont know about others but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share however the powerful elite obviously werent going to go for that so rather than understanding what che guevera wanted they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution it didnt work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off a good example of this was when castro continued his leadership in cuba as far as im concerned and as che said it himself right before he died if you kill me thats fine but youre only killing a man youll never kill the cause i couldnt have said it any better myselfbr br but  anyways thats why i give this film a 7 out of 10
