i came to watch guerrilla part two of steven soderberghs biopic of che guevara without having seen the preceding film and without more than a cursory knowledge of ches life at the same time i was rather apprehensive that this would be both a heavygoing history lesson and an unrepentant loveletter to the iconic revolutionary as it turns out this film far exceeded my expectationsbr br guerrilla works remarkably well as a standalone film the story of ches failed attempt to lead a revolution in bolivia then under military rule is a compelling tragedy the initial impetus brought by ches arrival incognito to lead the guerrilla war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune the odds stack up against the revolutionaries us backing for the bolivian army hostile conditions in the rainforest suspicious locals and ches failing health are just some of the difficulties which beset the nascent rebellionbr br soderberghs portrayal of che is largely uncritical but this film is no hagiography the style is refreshingly undramatic with a subtle and effective soundtrack by alberto iglesias adding quiet drama to many scenes che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few closeups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too where soderbergh wishes to demonstrate ches virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal acolyte who upbraids two fellow guerrillas when they question ches leadership and emphasises the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind cuba to fight again for revolutionbr br the direction throughout is superb part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience at the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in postrevolutionary cuba immediately furnishing us with ideas as to why che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country later on the portrayal of guerrillas marching through the unending rainforests stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the enormity of the task before this tiny band of revolutionariesbr br if there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and che which though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people around him makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person true benicio del toro is utterly convincing in the lead role Â– so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself however watching guerrilla as a standalone film means that we are given precious little insight into what is shaping ches thoughts words and actions it is to be hoped that this is more to the fore in the first part of soderberghs biopic i cannot comment on that yet and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel
