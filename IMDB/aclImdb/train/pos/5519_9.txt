i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i cant recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly id had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real thing about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 25 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully  i might say lovingly  made movie and im really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourselfbr br if there is a person on the planet who doesnt know ernesto che guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s ches image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers ches image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helpsbr br movies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics but i dont think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this twoparter is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mindbr br the first movie the agentine shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but arent the second film guerilla picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film benicio del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to playbr br personally i felt that the argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more entertaining in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat in much the same way that the recent valkyrie  while being a good movie  was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che guerilla we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises the movie does not romanticise him too much he kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless childrenbr br but overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didnt you think the end was like butch cassidy
