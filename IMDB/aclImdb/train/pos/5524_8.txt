neatly skipping over everything from the coup in cuba to his undercover entry into bolivia part two of soderberghs portrayal of che guevara is that of the tragic hero as with che  part one this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy so why was the film and particularly benicio del toros performance so loudly praised at cannesbr br james rocchi for instance called it a work of art thats not just the story of a revolutionary but a revolution in and of itself the guardians peter bradshaw called it a flawed masterpiece i return to my original contention for part one  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero rolemodels could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist thomas carlyle in his seminal book heroes and hero worship heroes can be real or imaginary or somewhere inbetween but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals a higher purpose compare this with the unrealistic heroes of standard western storytelling where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barelybelievable reward  usually everlasting love or material wealth  as if by divine studio intervention real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not lost ark daredevilishness or james bond supertoys they rise and empower others to rise to be the best that they can be in part one che succeeds in part two he fails it is not for want of moral courage but since a not all good plans can succeed and b being human mistakes are inevitablebr br guevaras intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed it is a serious miscalculationbr br high in the mountains from la paz the colours are breathtaking there is an air of miseenscene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che  part one the us would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital designed for flexibility and functionality the package weighs a mere 9 lbs shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time says soderbergh red sees the way i see    so organic so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena  light if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered not the political triumph critics will say  and with some justification  that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tinpot dictatorships his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves and have since been used for bothbr br but for all its praiseworthiness the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension we stumble from one escapade to another knowing that he will eventually meet his death i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter but the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevaras excomrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement it might not be topflight entertainment but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of historybr br there is also another very important point in the che hero figure here its about failure that if you try your utmost even if you fail your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage one could cynically call it a martyr complex and it is found of course in many religious figures as well but che does not sacrifice himself he does what he does best to the best of his not inconsiderate ability and so provides an example success or failure in any particular instance become mere detailsbr br with the uss longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba all in the name of freedom i am tempted to write that che parts 1  2 are too good to be wasted on the us but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders whatever its faults it rehabilitates soderbergh from the populist nonsense of oceans 11br br but if you havent heard of che guevara or seen part one or if you cant get past the phrase murderous marxist without frothing at the mouth i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film the same can be said for many who have and can
