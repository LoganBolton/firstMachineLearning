a lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining ignoring it is based on a true story or ranting against a film that glorifies che which it really doesnt this film is very close to jon andersons definitive bio on che and gets the story right soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was ches bolivian adventure you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the bolvian peasant to ches revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the terrain sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened so dont go into this movie expecting a rambo shoot em up its a true story
