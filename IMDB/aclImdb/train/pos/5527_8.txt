theres perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart having just said goodbye to my new fianc√©e  of ohone day  for an unknown period of time i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to seebr br i watched a few movies and tv shows but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i havent seen for that i have this movie to thankbr br being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand i was sure i was going to like it anyway but i didnt just like it i loved itbr br the technical mastery is astounding how did they do it how did they capture the animals in the way they did its just wonderfulbr br the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous its a happysad one again it caught me a bit offguard as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours perhaps its because the ending made me think back to what i leftbr br but for those few hours on the plane i was happy to see something new and original and thats life sure there are those things you love and feel comfortable aroundbut the great outdoors holds many a mystery so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open im going to explore it observe it and embrace it thats precisely what happens in this movie and thats precisely what you should do with this darn good movienature doc too 810 br br ps its two months on from the plane journey we still dont know when well see each other again but we will
