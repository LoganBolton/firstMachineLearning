this is a very beautiful and almost meditative filmthere is hardly any dialogue in it apart from the narration and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly i didnt at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend who also has red hair it is almost an old fashioned type of childrens films saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etcbut i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages not just children
