now admittedly im no ardent student of the genre as a matter of fact ive tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as americas primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey lets form a posse in other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality and yes i have seen at least some of the socalled greats and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment  including stagecoach rio bravo my darling clementine and of course the infamous but profoundly dull clint eastwoodsergio leone teamups in the 60sbr br but when i saw this movie on tv  as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death  i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation aside from just action and thrills it is the pushpull between lawlessness and order the american west represented freedom but also the prospect of the wild the untamed respectable folk could get hurt out there which of course meant that perhaps  just perhaps  it wasnt meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and freespirited enough to be out there in the first place and so reject society at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe after seeing this movie the highest and truest goal of any western sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and lets not even get started talking about the indians ok and there is precious little shades of gray in betweenbr br not in this one jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by walter brennan perhaps the western clich√© character to end them all  but nevertheless enjoyable here as always  and no one else pointedly they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his patented charm come on we could never really dislike the guy now could we we are left with little doubt that his is basically a selfcentered selfinterested character none of his gosh or oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above he must confront the lawlessness in himself and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners starting point on their gold dust trail this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances ive ever seen he comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy  so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force further by establishing a type of breezy if necessarily guarded camaraderie between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are  and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the filmbr br i wont go through all the twists and turns the plot takes  see those for yourself as well as the rugged and gorgeous alaskan scenery  filmed on location mind you not cheap painted stills that the studio made up whats key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time  although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static read talky definitely one of the greatest performances ive seen from stewart showing he could play the renegade the mans man just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door if anything in fact his everyman qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less mythic or overblown  like say eastwood or john wayne  and more a threedimensional personage his relationship with brennan is wellplayed understated but nevertheless touching with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from of mice and men  an altogether different type of westernbr br i certainly have more westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is
