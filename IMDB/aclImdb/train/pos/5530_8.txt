a must see for anyone who loves photography stunning and breathtakingleaves you in ore seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something elsebr br took my two daughters to see this and they loved it my oldest cried at the endbut she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop its simple telling of a childs love for nature and in particular a fox is told well in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate which works for children very well not being preached to is very important you make your own mind upbr br but the star of this film is the cinematographers how did they do what they did amazing just amazing
