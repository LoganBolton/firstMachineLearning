maybe im biased to foxes fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully donebr br i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasnt comfortable such as the fire and the room trying not to spoil too much here i think thats important for kids to see and try to understandbr br after reading a few others comments im a bit confused one says that at the end spoiler the mother and her son appear as shes been the one telling her son about her story the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end merely a painting of a girl with a fox can someone enlighten me on that anyway i really enjoyed this movie although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through still worth it if they can sit still
