a couplejanet and richard go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp after camping and enjoying nature the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house soon a pair of escaped convicts show up and after much delaying of the inevitable they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcagebr br this last house on the leftlike film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made its one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers moreover i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in its perverse tone i love caged terror the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty i found the film to be quite creepybr br the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering while i didnt mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question i do think that it will both most people the acting isnt too good nor is the dialogue at least in the early scenes this film takes a little more patience than usual and its really not for everyonebr br in short this was a good film not the greatest horror film ive ever seen but it is certainly a lot of fun its not exactly the easiest film to find its possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough its not for everyone but if youre a fan of trash cinema then its definitely worth checking out
