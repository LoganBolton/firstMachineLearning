probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and whats more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging pervasive fog this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbars inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine beautiful spirited yet vulnerable robert barrat delivers his usual nononsense straightdowntheline portrait of the local bigwig though its hard to believe that the personable goodlooking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writerdirector blake edwards
