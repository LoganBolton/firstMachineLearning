 includes spoilers br br ive been a horror film fan now for many decades just when i think ive seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me i had never seen this film before it was a treat off the beaten path toonot just the path to the swamp ferry boat either here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different the pretty girl is gulp fearless for a change and saves the men including the man she loves from the monster  how is that for a twist this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time no screaming at her own shadow no fainting from fright no tripping over a leaf as she runs this gal wasnt afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers not only that but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted heck she even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoorslike a regular 1940s version of ripley no snake gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked workbr br see this if you are a fan like me of those wonderfully atmospheric classic bw horror films they made only in the 30s and 40s and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection
