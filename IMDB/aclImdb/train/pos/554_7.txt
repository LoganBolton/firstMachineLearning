contains slight spoilersbr br its interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here stewart is of course remembered by many as george bailey from frank capras its a wonderful life so its easy to find parallels between the two films in its a wonderful life bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born in the far country stewarts jeff webster by not getting involved to help anyone else except himself gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he for all practical matters doesnt existbr br by not getting involved and by attempting not to care about anyone webster is forced to see those for whom he cant help but care get hurt pushed around and even killed while he stands by and does nothing this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upsidedown because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born br br both movies end with the same image  a closeup of a ringing bell stewart by turning around his philosophy of noninvolvement has it would seem earned his wings
