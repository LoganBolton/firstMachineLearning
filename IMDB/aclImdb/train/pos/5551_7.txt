i really wanted to like this film and i dont think i was terribly disappointed being an american history teacher i felt an obligation almost to see this film and as far as the history went it wasnt bad sure there were a few mistakes here and there especially with the timelinethe movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a yearnot over six years of actual fighting but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent unfortunately the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist for the most part it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed tacked onlike a plot device instead of a real honesttogoodness romance in fact as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb clich√© of love at fist sight it was kind of annoying the more i think about itbr br however in spite of this romance the film is truly interesting and inspiringplus in so many ways it seems as if the much later film the patriot was copied from this griffith film both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civiliansand both having the secret intention of using this as a springboard to starting their own nation in the america the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d w griffith for the story ideas it just doesnt seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each otherbr br psdespite me liking this film and some other of griffiths films he does deserve to once again burn in hell for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his filmsespecially in birth of a nation i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was aok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this quaint institution dont get mad at methis is meant as sarcasm
