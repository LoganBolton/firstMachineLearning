i waited until the 4th of july to write this because    well    because it just feels right to be doing it on this daybr br in 1924 dw griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm 1921 hed been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution dar who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasnt a trace of patrick henry anywherebr br we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague carol dempster a leading lady for griffith for many years complicating matters is the fact that nancys father hates nathan    well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathans arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancys dadbr br paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empirebr br comparisons with birth of a nation 1915 are inevitable the montague family might just as well be the camerons from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army in this case the redcoats storming a trench packed with patriots the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no mans land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isnt scope gw billy bitzers camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is    dare i say it    sinceritybr br the brutality of capt butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen dont expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance 1916 in one scene butlers second in command capt hare louis wolhiem gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on hares face as he obviously has a good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912 a story goes that he approached griffith for work and dw knowing the reputation of his famous family said i am not hiring stage actors to which lionel replied and i am nothing of the kind sir he makes a very good and quite believable villain louis wolhiem appeared with lionels older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr jekyll and mr hyde both 1920 and later in the tempest 1927 as capt hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad alsobr br neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and i was scared to death he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually wanedbr br speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul reveres ride he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce to arms the regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground i am amazed griffith did not do another takebr br so is america a classic yes dont wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime
