slow but beautifullymounted story of the american revolution griffiths storytelling seems a lot less heavyhanded than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action lionel barrymore is an utter swine neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is well carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period but she doesnt show up often enough to slow the pace and dramabr br note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes however the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hoursbr br far better in terms of storytelling than sound versions such as the patriot while not quite in the league of griffiths best such as way down east and broken blossoms an excellent way to spend a couple of hours
