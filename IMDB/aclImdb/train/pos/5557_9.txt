a mouse in the house is a very classic cartoon by tom  jerry faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own it is hysterical hilarious very entertaining and quite amusing artwork is of good quality eitherbr br this short isnt just about tom trying to catch jerry butch lives in the same house and hes trying to catch the mouse too because «theres only going to be one cat in this house in the morning  and thats the cat that catches the mouse»br br if you ask me there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon the funniest for me are for example when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «im glad youre enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes theyre satisfied because she aint making the two cats gasp another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom of course that even funnier than this is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both dumb cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the rear  lol naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad she isnt someone to mess with but even jerry doesnt win this time because he is expelled by her too
