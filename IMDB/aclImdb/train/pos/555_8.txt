my comment would have been added to the release date section but i couldnt find a place for it i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the us in feb 1955 i saw it in a first run theater in washington dc in march 1958 wonder if it was rereleased or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters john mcintyre does a bangup job as a corrupt judgeentrepreneurthief walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirtysix minutes
