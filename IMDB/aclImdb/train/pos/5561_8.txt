ok needless to say this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience namely stoners and likeminded peoplebr br that being said if you are one of these aformentioned people this film is a must in fact i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong what monty pythons holy grail is to geeks and nerds so is this movie to potheads i first saw this film 10 years ago or so and i still crack up every time i watch it the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle far better than latter day knockoffs like halfbaked attempt tobr br there isnt a plot so to speak the film is more of a collection of various skits as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze despite this the film has an excellent sense of pace and doesnt drag at all many people cite up in smoke as ccs best work but i would have to say that next movie is superiorbr br so if youre in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs light up tune in and let your mind float away br br oh and free tommy chong
