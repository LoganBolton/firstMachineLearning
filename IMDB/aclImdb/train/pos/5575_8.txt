i didnt expect much from this but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes this might be a film for you ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half its certainly not a momentous work of comedy but given the lowbudget indy genesis this is masterful to level the playing field for comparison imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through i look forward to his next effort
