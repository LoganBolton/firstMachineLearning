no need to recap the plot since others have done so alreadybr br its understandable that many viewers find fault with the film raised as we are with the slambang sensurround of todays cineplex experience against that background a movie like ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet i think there are several worthwhile reasons whybr br most importantly the film unfolds poetically as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills trees clouds etc providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from todays technologydriven cinema where rapidfire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it additionally the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear with almost no dialogue to explain whats happening this amounts to another extreme departure from todays very literal fare where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience but perhaps most unsettling the movie is sometimes eerily quiet not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be but in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to thus the burden of the story is shared between the filmmaker and the viewer the former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative while the latter must think about those visuals since theyre not going to be explainedbr br none of this is intended to belittle todays filmmaking its simply to point out that a movie like machatys comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today i dont claim either to be any better or worse however i do claim that ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from todays moviegoing experience where such contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring br br the film itself is no masterpiece though at times it reaches artistic heights as in the beautifully composed beergarden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below the slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life nature and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed these are the kind of scenes that dont overwhelm you but instead given halfa chance accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spinetingling variety of a jaws br br on the other hand the film is sometimes heavyhanded as when machaty piles on the imagery particularly in the final odetolabor sequence its hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the lovelorn hero and people in general a theme then being promoted by the influential soviet cinema still its presence here is rather tediously overdonebr br anyhow ive got to admit that i tuned in initially to see the gorgeous hedy lamarr in the buff but now i have to admit that in the process i also got a lot more than just a peekaboo romp in the woods
