famous for introducing the world to hedy lamarr and full frontal nudity but its oh so much more in fact this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry up there with some of the seminal works of 1930s art cinema in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of paris tabu olympia and even latalante its nearly a silent relying mostly on its miraculous images and also its fantastic symphonic score by giuseppe becce its a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting a good 90 of the film moves along perfectly machat√Ω seems an expert at using motifs perhaps not as subtle as it could be and perhaps a bit overused but the appearances of objects like insects lights and horses carry the story forward beautifully the small snatches of dialogue are thankfully unintrusive they dont jar as much as one would imagine the final bit is odd to say the least reminiscent of russian silents we have a montage of workers this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative but its so gorgeously done that i refuse to harp too much on that flaw ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery it belongs amongst the best films ever made
