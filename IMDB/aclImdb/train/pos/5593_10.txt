this film could have been a silent movie it certainly has the feel of one i was extremely extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film extase is a symphony of love and transcends all language versions french which is the ultimate romantic language seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical versiona young hedy lamarr lights up the screen in this film which in a way is almost like a sex fantasy but definitely far from being pornographictech qualities may have been a little crude but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudesmany lovers of early cinema would absolutely adore this film
