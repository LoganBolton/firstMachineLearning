this was my second time watching the film via the frenchlanguage version as opposed to the first which was dubbed in italian and i feel that it improves on subsequent viewingsbr br a compelling if slowly builtup character study thats beautifully shot and with the parisian settings being equally impressive in the long run its not topgrade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but its still a confident mix of subtle chills and surprisingly often broad comedy it also features a fine cast all of whom are in good form but especially isabelle adjani melvyn douglas and jo van fleetbr br even so im a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for trelkovsky to change into the previous tenant apart from the owner of the caf√© opposite the apartment building where he is given whatever simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different there is little to indicate as far as i could discern anyway that this is what everybody wanted of him okay so he found simones belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom the last section of the film where adjani all but disappears is almost anticlimactic  especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the opera a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by jean cocteau in the blood of a poet 1930br br the ending then is at once predictable and unresolved just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window i remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well and im sorry to say its no clearer now mind you the films first twothirds are pretty solid but i wish that polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout
