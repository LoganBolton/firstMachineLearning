a good film withfor its timean intense sprawling rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john fords the searchers though not so brutal the story starts fast and doesnt let up with several scenes of really good dialog between stewarts jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river 1952 also a mannstewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting there are a few caveats a tooquickly wrapped up and rather sentimental ending 24yearold corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics dont apply but these are trivial concerns james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery cant be beat a fine western costume drama
