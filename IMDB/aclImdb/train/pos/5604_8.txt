if you liked roman polanskis repulsion you should probably check out the tenant since its a similar concept just with polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko this is actually one of my favorites of his movies  second after rosemarys baby of course  and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim the other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down  even the slightest titter becomes a big deal and polanski who stars becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize its only a matter of time before he decides tor reenact her fatal leap out the window the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie you should know its going to end with a bang and this flick doesnt disappoint its also best if you dont question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness because its pretty trippy surreal at times polanski is very good as the timid deranged resident who somehow attracts the ever illustrious isabelle adjani we also get to see him running around in drag which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time damn he makes for one ugly chick so polanski fans  who can actually look past his thirty yearold pedophile charges  should enjoy the tenant as an entertaining psychological headtrip
