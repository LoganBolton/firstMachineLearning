when this film opened back in 1976 legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain  it was widely considered a failure i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at cannesbr br apparently these people didnt understand the movie which is not that hard to comprehend since its very esoteric dark and layered in ways that still astound me reading through many of the reviews here i find even after about 78 viewings over the years many elements of the film i had previously glossed over but even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story its still a cracking suspensereven if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes polanskis title character like a tsunami wave over the course of its two hour running timebr br examining the source material  an excellent novella by underrated novelist roland topor  uncovers more intriguing layers polanskis trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life letting it direct him he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes he finds himself gently pushed this way and that but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless this vague sort of wishywashyness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie but there are hints of it early in the film toobr br making a play for the apartment of a woman one mademouiselle choule who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain he soon finds however that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the doorbr br instead of taking a stand though trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution he becomes obsessed with choule imagining himself to be like her dressing like her etc as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanitybr br if anyone has ever doubted polanskis fearlessness as an artist theyd be welladvised to see this film his trademark black humor is prominently and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and  god bless him  he makes himself the butt of it its a tour de force performance in one of the richest riskiest most gothic horror movies ever made that more people havent seen it is a true crime
