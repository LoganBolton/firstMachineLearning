another very good mann flick thanks to the fatherson combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan ben tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river rio bravo hes there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend youre wrong mr dunston jeff websterstewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither and suffers for itbr br the caption above plays on tatums assertion that he cant live without his coffee this nicotine addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the screenbr br i recommend this film and now own the dvd
