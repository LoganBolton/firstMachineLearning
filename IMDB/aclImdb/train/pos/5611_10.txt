i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously i believed totally in the poor characters psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites dust squalor selfishness rudeness malice and decay im giving all the credit to polanskis artistry in his direction his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatres manager luckily for me my life on my own didnt turn out as disastrous as this so far but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the fake reality he is trying to convey simply put the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race this film is the sum of many many instances of great acting and great casting as some performances were done in english the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others and others in french with most other characters and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french i heartily recommend if you happen to be bilingual to switch the audio from french to english and viceversa during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd this film is part of polanskis socalled apartment building trilogy which also comprises repulsion and rosemarys baby unfortunately repulsion still hasnt made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1 needless to say the three films would make a magnificent boxset
