im a pretty old dude old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 5055 years ago when every taste for a kid was fresh i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker so that i could taste those things today this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how ive drifted physically and otherwise a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations over the half century they would have had to adjust quite a bit because you see i would have known that i set them aside eating one now would be a celebration of self and past and story and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated rewardbr br i didnt have enough sense to do that with original coke and i couldnt have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then but i did something almost as good in the seventies i really tuned into roman polanski he was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know movies smuggled out of the soviet block movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward movies that make you want to live with polish women one and then deciding that they would be the last to get itbr br heres what i did i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside i did not watch it i deferred until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it over the years i would test myself my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it there probably are few poles who have worked at this practicing to deserve chopin working to deserve womanness when i see it trying to get the inners from the edgesbr br recently i achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work optimally because i had already seen and understood 9th gatebr br if you do not know this it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant about whom the story is named jumped out the window to die later after this man played by polanski visits what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad but the way we follow him he is not he merely has flashes that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his realitybr br the story hardly matters what matters is how polanksi shapes this thing both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh the two never meet there is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wigbr br i know of no one else that could do this this sketch that remains a sketch this horror that remains naturalbr br to understand the genius of this you have to know one of the greatest films ever made rear window the genius of that film is the postnoir notion that the camera shapes the world that the viewer creates the story what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out in rear window the idea was that the onscreen viewer jimmy stewart was the anchor and everything else was fiction woven as we watched here the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker we know this we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator we know it is true that bodies shift identity that times shift that causality is plastic we know that the narrator will kill us we know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine br br teds evaluation  4 of 3 every cineliterate person should experience this
