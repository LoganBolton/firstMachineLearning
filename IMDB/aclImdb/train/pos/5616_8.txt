what can be said really the tenant is a firstclass thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and fullblown paranoia its an intricatelyplotted filmevery detail seems included for a reasoneven though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanskia meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenants suicideto guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartmentwarming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfuk on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score its a movie thats better experienced than described so hop to it
