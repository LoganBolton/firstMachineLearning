after his classic film noir homage chinatown roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which like repulsion and rosemarys baby deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment livingbr br claustrophobic environments are the ones which polanski is best at creating and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created the emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed but the tenant is not just confined spatially but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist trelkovsky played by polanski himself is not only in every scene he is in virtually every shot when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes trelkovskys point of view and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirrorbr br i cant think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character some psychological thrillers like m or peeping tom manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist others like psycho attempt indepth scientific analysis of his mental condition the tenant fits into neither of these categories Â– it simply immerses us completely inside trelkovskys experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head we feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrationalbr br polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences why precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia a much later polanski horror the ninth gate is a bit of a mess plotwise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dreadbr br this is a rare chance to see polanski himself in a major role his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it and he is absolutely perfect as the meek trelkovsky another standout performance is that of the alltoooften overlooked shelley winters as the concierge in actual fact it is rather a stellar cast although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange gothic european movie also sadly many of the french actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the english language versionbr br the tenant is more polished and less pretentious than repulsion but it lacks the suspense and the character that make rosemarys baby so engrossing and entertaining the tenant is good with no major flaws and polanski was really on top form as a director but its not among his most gripping works
