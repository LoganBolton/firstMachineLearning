i once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight  so needless to say i can easily relate to polanskis the tenant br br but i also enjoy the film for other reasons im not sure that it works on the whole  the polanski characters descent into paranoia and madness which takes up the final half hour or so seems rather jarring and bizarre ebert for one was totally unconvinced and he slapped the movie with a vicious onestar review but i think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully so even though i dont quite understand the whole film  what does egyptology have to do with it for example  i still have an overall positive impression of itbr br i love the obnoxious friend portrayed by bernard fresson for example god how many times have i settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all i love the movie theater scene  the funniest making out moment in the history of film id say and boy do i love isabelle adjani  shes so foxy in this movie its almost unbelievable and she gives a great performance as alwaysbr br polanski is a good actor too i dont agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here his character is supposed to be lowkey and thoughtful so his lowkey performance fits i for one found him perfectly sympathetic  though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reasonbr br yes the movies obscure and slow but it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living  something ive done entirely too much of  so i dig it its funny how all you need is a common reference point and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant definitely worth picking up for pocket change on dvd
