roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemarys baby and chinatown probably what makes polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever donebr br polanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the buildingbr br while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films repulsion  rosemarys baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovskys head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenantbr br trelkovskys descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the filmbr br also the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractivebr br if a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovskys own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this onebr br while the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksis masterpieces 1010
