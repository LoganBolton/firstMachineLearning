farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays marjorie a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a wouldbe rapist well done to farrah for being a golden globe best actress nomineebr br when her rapist joe terrifically played by james russo comes into her home which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out marjorie has to play along with joes frightening demands it does make for some disturbing and shocking imagesbr br when her roommates come home they are astounded to say the least by marjories actions and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police makes the film even more nailbitingbr br i do find diana scarwid quite irritating but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeedbr br overall extremities is a brilliantly thoughtout and wellacted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now well done to everybody involved
