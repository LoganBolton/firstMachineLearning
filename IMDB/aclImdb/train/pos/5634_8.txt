extremities is the disturbing yet riveting screen version of a play by william mastriosimone who adapted his own play for the screen about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a wouldbe rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives after her roommates leave for work the next day the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her the story takes a surprising twist when at one point the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested he will just get off she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him farfetched maybe disturbing definitely but theres a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker that you cant help but feel completely a part of whats going on i did not see the play on broadway but i would imagine a piece like this works better onstage but that doesnt make this film any less riveting an experience farrah fawcett one of the last actresses to do the role on broadway was awarded the role of marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim many critics found fawcetts performance to be onenote but for me marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me james russo in the performance of his career is slimy and menacing as the wouldbe rapist who finds marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed alfre woodard and diana scarwid costar as marjories roommates who come home after marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival and its the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didnt see what we saw marjorie go through and therefore think she should call the police and let them handle the guy not for the faint of heart but if you can stand it a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you
