ive read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so lets focus on the movie and the messagebr br i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10br br i like poprock music im 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didnt recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any self promotionbr br i watch movies to be entertained i dont care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain mebr br i watched this movie for the message the worlds greatest epidemic is low selfesteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give updont give up message so yeh it was a bit predictable great message thoughshould be more of thembr br this movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal
