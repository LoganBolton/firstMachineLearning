i really think that this movie is great personally but in every movie there is a downer now some of you may not have watched hilary duffs raise your voice but if you think about it those two shows are very very similar if you know what i mean in brave new girl holly wants so bad to get into haverty conservatory in raise your voice terri wants to go to a conservatory in ladont remember the name of the conservatory there they are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester its really funny how these two films are alike i personally like brave new girl better than raise your voice though
