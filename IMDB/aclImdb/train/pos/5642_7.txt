spoilers in first paragraph this movies antigerman sentiment seems painfully dated now but its a brilliant example of great wartime propaganda it was made back when cecil b demille was still a great director ignore all his later best picture academy awards he never made a very good sound film this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickfords other films and really it was demilles movie not pickfords the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way the patriot of 2000 did the same to the british the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim they even had pickford take an illfated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine so whatll get the americans more stirred up to war the sinking of the lusitania or watching americas favorite canadian import sinking in it all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another barely escaping death hypothermia depravity rape execution and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in jurassic park were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a partgerman ancestry br br was it a good film aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking theyre untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained youll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously onesided but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkins false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movies potential for propaganda it made me wonder what became of cecil b demille somewhere between the advent of sound and the greatest show on earth he seemed to lose his ambition ben hur looked expensive but not ambitious in a sentence this movie is for 1 film historians 2 silent film buffs 3 mary pickford fans or 4 demille fans if such a person exists
