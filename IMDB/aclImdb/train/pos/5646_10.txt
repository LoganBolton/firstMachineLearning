recently when i was shopping i saw the boxset of americian gothic and i thought i remember that i used to set my alarm to get back up  watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 130am i was 14 i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck with a b no one ever was anyway br br what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the boxset as when on tv episodes in funny order i kept thinking when does dr matt leave  they made it so confusing br br however this is not the writers producers or directors fault its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same  just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they dont like originality in studiosbr br to finish  if youve not seen this and you call yourself a scifi fantasy horror supernatural dramafan  you must they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the boxset
