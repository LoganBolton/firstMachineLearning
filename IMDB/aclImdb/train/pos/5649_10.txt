im watching the series again now that its out on dvd yay its striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first airedbr br the central performances are gripping the scripts are layeredbr br ill stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show thatll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035br br ive been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb waybr br well unlike imdbs submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everythingbr br in 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situationbr br when the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally im starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it dont get more controversial than that
