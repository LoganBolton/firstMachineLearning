i really like this show i can readily see how it achieved cult status its original and thought provoking for some reason though i have never felt the kind of resonance from it that i could have it doesnt pack the kind of open door winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise each time i watch an episode i find myself prodding and pushing for it to answer some nameless formless questionbr br before continuing let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion and my opinion only different strokes for different folksbr br i would have liked to have seen more scenes in american gothic that were shot at night theres too much daylight in this show and i think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense were not afraid of the daylight after all were concerned about whats in the shadows the devil isnt always in the details what were not seeing is often the most frighteningbr br secondand this is the one thats probably going to lead to tar and feathers gary cole is a tremendously talented actora character actor ive followed his career from the brady bunch films on which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck hes almost too petroichan too likable to be embodiment of evil even by biblical standards lucas buck is a narcotic hes heroin hes freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of draino you keep going back even though you know the end will be madness and death he should be like the ultimate loan shark hes a maker of book but also of unspeakable condemnation sure youve got the money and before long youre also going to have broken fingers a severed hand a decapitated head and eventually a damned soul turning to buck is an act of desperation and whenever hes around there should be some immediate ambient finalitywith interest compounded dailyin the airbr br its all largess all strings attached and by the time you realize that youll also know that its too latebr br which leads me to three they showed buck a little too often hes in most of the scenes in fact which may have caused him to lose his edge the sheriff would be like the next door mythology hes the apocryphal acquaintance many would know of him but only an unfortunate few would really know him hed be the stuff of flashbacks and cryptic conversations and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick searcy portrayedbr br four the show could be very selfreverentialto a fault some might sayand this is typified by the whistling of meet me at the fishing hole in the series pilot i think weve already established that what cassidy and raimi were shooting for was the antiandy taylor we probably didnt need the concept delivered to us via fed ex i gathered that within the first five minutes so for me the piano on the head was unnecessarybr br these remarks are all about what for me would have made a good show great i also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup in their everlasting quest for lcd programming the network played a definite role in the demise of this seriesbr br the least these jerkoff suits could have done was to air the episodes in orderbr br get realbr br either way its a grievous loss to both genre fans and casual viewers alike
