definitely spoilers in this review i adore american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on ch4 in the uk when i was 14 the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right its small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters best of all and the reason i love it so much is it had the guts to never be black and white lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by as he says giving people enough rope to hang themselves with his manipulation only works because of other peoples weak morals caleb though generally a thoughtful kind insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in the plague sower not only that but having gail the closest thing to a mother figure for caleb not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it im a huge buffy fan but when that show tried to go really dark in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost its humorous side and didnt commit fully to its ideas ag shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show and still have a hell of laugh doing itbr br i cant even think about why it was cancelled as ill just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all so much rubbish on tv and good original shows get kicked around and stamped on thanks to the emergence of dvd at least i can see the show in its entirety yes some of the visuals look dated now but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera workbr br the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it isnt like the xfiles where there are cases to solve or lost where theres huge unanswered questions its pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers and that the show is all about fighting for calebs soul so this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown truth to find yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects with some such as the truth about gails parents getting resolved but unlike lost and xfiles this show isnt about trying to find out more facts about whats going on imo its all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of trinity personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantagebr br all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out im pretty certain most fantasyhorror fans will love it also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt having him not be in the final episodes is strange br br i would have done anything for a second season but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv execs appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all
