i stumbled on this series rather by accident after half an episode i was hooked american gothic was a dark strange series with gary cole as the mysterious probably evil sheriff buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son caleb played by lucas black i was impressed with gary coles sinister sheriff and i was even more impressed with lucas black lucas blacks caleb was able to stand up against sheriff buck one of the most frightening characters ever created for a tv series i have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as lucas black if you were not lucky enough to see lucas in american gothic see him in slingbladebr br it was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during its short run
