in this installment of the series edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain during the later portion of george iiis rule this time blackadders prospects are much pooreras instead of royalty hes a servant to the very very thick george iv the price regent unlike the historical accounts of george iv this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result blackadders able to take advantage of him and scheme to his hearts content the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very very very different noteyou just have to see it to believe it other than that all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious the only reservation i have as always is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations
