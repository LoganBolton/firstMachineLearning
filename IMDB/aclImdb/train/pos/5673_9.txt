i think blackadder the third is the best one of the seriesbr br actuelly all the episodes are funny personally i really like the episode with the french invasion but the one with the superstitious actors in macbeth is also really funny the way rowan keeps playing on with them is really english humor at the highest levelbr br actors never say that again always call it the scottish play blackadder oh so you want me to say the scottish play actors yes blackadder rather than macbethbr br i am a big fan of rowan and i have the majority of his work but i think he did the series of blackadder especially goodbr br i hope rowan is going to continue his great style but i think we can count on him because he is already working on a bean 2 movie that will be out this year i cant waitbr br i give this 3rd blackadder a 9 out of 10 rating
