this time around blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the prince regent portrayed by hugh lauriewho replaces tim mcinnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but care for him which isnt at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a buffoon they always are he doesnt seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head  or marry them  on a whim here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i cant tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered baldrick doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof dont get me started on the grossout stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didnt really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general 710
