blackadder 3 is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of  it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it but it is still great  a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson writer of the first dictionary in england make this series one to be reckoned with there are still more hilarious oneliners to be delivered in this series and it brings out the humour in a lesserknown era  in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes blackadders third outing is not the most famous and wellknown of the lot but rowan atkinsons role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one and hugh laurie is at his best in this series very good 910
