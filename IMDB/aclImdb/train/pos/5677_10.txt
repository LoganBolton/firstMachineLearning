the 3rd and in my view the best of the blackadder seriesbr br the only downside is that there is no lord percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but hugh lauries prince regent is suitably madcap laugh a linebr br as a package its quality through and through with convincing regency sets superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky the macbeth actors standing out and prince georges lucky us chicken impression and the missing words from dr johnsons dictionarybr br few comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly its a scream
