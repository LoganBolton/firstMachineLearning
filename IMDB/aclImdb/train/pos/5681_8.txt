i had no problem with the film which i thought was pretty good its the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me i wonder if lions gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place sorry lions gate this was an incredibly bad ideabr br getting back to the film the cast was excellent especially val kilmer as the late john holmes john holmes was a sleaze mistreats the women in his life lisa kudrow as his wife kate bosworth as his girlfriendand he is hopelessly deep into drugs his connection to eddie nash eric bogosiancreates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders we may never know the entire truth to the storynash is still alive and a free manbut the film does a pretty good job nonetheless
