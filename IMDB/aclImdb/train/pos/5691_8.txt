i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters however i wasnt able to get around to it so finally it hit the shelves and i picked it up not knowing exactly what to expect i plopped the dvd in the player settled in the for an evening of murder and pressed play what followed was one of the more engaging flicks ive seen in the last couple yearsbr br some spoilersbr br this is the story of the wonderland murders which led to the seediest parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70s john holmes val kilmerbr br i was hooked from the beginning and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning and the actual showing of the murders towards the end the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting val kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star and even the beautiful but thats it bosworth was a joy to watch and just for her looks mind youbr br i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was as i mentioned its lack of outright showing the murders it was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you couldnt completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome furthermore the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite they were being beating with lead pipes theres not much more that needs to be saidbr br my only real problem was carrie fishers brief appearence her portrayal of the overlyreligious figure was i think a bit too cliche of her appearence maybe that person was actually part of the story maybe not but i wasnt sold and for some reason fisher seemed a bit too akward in her portrayalbr br overall an excellent movie worth the watch even if oncebr br 810
