what do you do with a 14inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder and then died of aids you make a movie of course the probable reason why it wasnt made earlier is the fact that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production so its no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after nash was sent to prisonbr br the best thing about the movie is its quick pace there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap and why would it be there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenesthe cast is good kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies so here was finally a role quite suitable for him bosworth is cute so its irrelevant how she acts shes solid and mcdermott who is otherwise quite annoying is rather good to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i didnt recognize him at first i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i wouldnt have to watch his dumb face i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate and wouldnt have known she was in it had i not seen her name in the endcredits kudrow is charming as ever a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role btw friends is the worst tv sitcom of all time the only casting choices that were questionable were an early nearcameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo you thought id include paris hilton too didnt you no i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10second appearance as a dumb whore because the film is about decadence among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly
