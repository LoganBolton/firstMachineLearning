this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first placebr br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survivedbr br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that ive seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herselfbr br this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesnt happen very oftenbr br home room is a beautiful film and thats all there is too it
