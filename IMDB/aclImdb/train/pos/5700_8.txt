ive read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd to be honest i really dont know what the problem with it isbr br its a decent murder mystery thriller shown from various points of view from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killerssuspects including the late porn king john holmes please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movies plot  i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsisbr br many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really dont see it many modern movies were worse  saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes afterallbr br i was enthralled with both halves of the movie  the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath the movie has excellent acting even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his bikeresque personia and goateeed bad boy personalitybr br the soundtrack was also awesome  a fantastic mix of 70s bside rock and obscure pop spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights
