i didnt expect val kilmer to make a convincing john holmes but i found myself forgetting that it wasnt the porn legend himself in fact the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly underrated moviebr br as some have mentioned earlier seek out the twodisc set and watch the wadd documentary first it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie br br some people seem unhappy about the lapd crime scene video being included on the dvd there are a number of reasons that it might have been included one of which is that john holmes trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the prosecution if you dont want to see it its easy to avoid its clearly identified as lapd crime scene footage on the menu
