had this movie been made just a few years later i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor at times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the inbetweenscenes normal ambient sounds are missing but given it was 1931 and a french movie this is quite forgivable especially since this also occurs in later french filmsby which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely such as in latalante from 1934br br okay apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it and during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you cant help but like a nice charming film allinall
