this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short lighthearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30s to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema its simply filled with music and an adorable mood thats really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it wouldnt be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didnt even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
