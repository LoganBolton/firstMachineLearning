havent seen any of the japanese grudgefilms but i really enjoy this one i rarely get scared when watching films i can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me but i did get scared from grudge maybe because i didnt expect anything at all when i watched it i didnt expect getting scared i didnt know anything about it either that was probably a good thingbr br this is a film that you apparently either love or hate most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudgefilms but even though i havent seen them i believe it isnt right to compare any film actually this film stands on it its ownbr br the story is weak most people say i dont agree the story is minimalistic and done so on purpose the storytelling techniques used  the broken time frame for instance  is perfectly done the director knows exactly what hes doing and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted itbr br i gave this film 8 of 10 it is a film you will enjoy watching or hate its as simple as that
