omigosh this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever ever seen to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement and i have seen heaps considering the limited availability in new zealand thats quite a lot but never before have i had to sleep with the light onuntil i saw the grudgebr br some may say that it is a rip off of the ring both based on japanese horror movies both similar yet different story lines but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie  seeing at at the cinema i even screamed at a certain point in the moviebr br the acting is great particularly from the supporting characters  kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show she is such an enthusiastic person jason behr is a real hottie and william mapother looks like he is having fun however while i am normally a fan of clea duvalls she doesnt really seem into this movie of the supporting characters hers probably got the most depth and back story but she doesnt seem like she is all there as for sarah michelle gellar well she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesnt she the ghosts were genuinely scary the music and sound effects were chilling particularly the noise being made when kadee stricklands character answered the phone in her apartment the ending was cool toobr br super highly recommended 910
