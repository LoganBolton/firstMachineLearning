i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb i worried about seeing a bad movie well i had fun watching the movie some parts which obviously were meant to be scary were actually quite humoristic almost as in buffy the vampire slayerbr br i dont consider this a bad movie its not a great movie either just a rather well made horror movie it does not rely heavily on special effects but on camera angles acting music in my opinion the acting was ok sarah did a very good job quite convincing the other actors were definitely not bad either i liked yokobr br the sets are nice and i dont care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese originalbr br the scary moments were often predictable but not always i have seen quite some horror and did not expect to be scared now but it happened at least twice nicebr br the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original like the trails of rubbish the simple special effects for he ghosts the eyes of the boy the cat that made eery noises the gurgling of the dead boy and his motherbr br dont go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode because it is very different from her buffy work much more serious dont go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations its a good horror movie enough suspense i gave it a 7
