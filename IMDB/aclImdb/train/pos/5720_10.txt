i saw the grudge yesterday and wow i was really scared a good thing i love horrormovies and i really liked this one there were so many surprisescenes whats the english word that made you jump in your seat though too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh i think the most scary scene was on the bus when the face flashes by on the window or when yokos walking without her chin the makeup is also very good sometimes you could really see it was there but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene the boy was very good indeed so cute without makeup and so terribly scary with it on the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared
