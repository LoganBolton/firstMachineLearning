im not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically antigrudge people are talking about here perhaps its just that some people like to rant about thingsbr br the movie was certainly imperfect uneven acting some may have had difficulties with the timechanges actors all too willing to go places id really rather not go etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfectionsbr br first and foremost i loved the breaking of the rules bit normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone giving you time to regroup get friends and find the token mysterious paranormal type normally semispoiler alert when youre hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because youve found out theyre just misunderstood or theyve been freed or whateverbr br secondly the production was exceptional while the movie was hardly specialeffectsladen the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well donebr br probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against em theyve got their place but great for those whove begun to take the conventions for granted and who dont have trouble with the time distortions
