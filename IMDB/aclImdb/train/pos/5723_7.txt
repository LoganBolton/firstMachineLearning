so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies its been a while since ive seen one that really made me jump or fidget nervouslybr br definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i dont get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible well if thats what you think then so be it i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared so i have to say that this one is worth watchingbr br now you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story i think that if it was shown in chronological order it would have ruined the whole thingbr br im actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you dont have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid
