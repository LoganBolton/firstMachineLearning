karen sarah michelle gellar an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semicatatonic woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker yoko yoko maki disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in emmas home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goesbr br maybe its a delayed influence from the success of m night shyamalans films but slowerpaced understated horror films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek 2005 the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise 2005 the pacing tends to kill the film i didnt like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek but this is still a very good filmit earns a 9 out of 10 from mebr br the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with juon 2000 in particular its extremely close to the first half of juon the grudge aka juon 3 from 2003 two as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isnt so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmarebr br director takashi shimizu also the director of the five japanese entries in the juon series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewersscares how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to filmmaking although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the juon series traditionally american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster a more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isnt yet accepted by the mainstream in the usbr br however even if youre not used to it its worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic juon 3 good cinematography subtle production design touches check out gellars clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of emmas house when gellar first approaches and beautifully effective horror materialbr br even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture its interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary childrenbr br i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clich√©d mysterythriller territory with a heres what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a 10 out of 10br br now that ive said all of the above let me finish with a minirant its not that im antiremake but it is ridiculous that us distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption the original versions of these films should just be playing in us theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for nonwhite or foreign actors yes the grudge is a fine film but ultimately id rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror filmsnot just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etcat my multiplex in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more costeffective to do this as 1 you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and 2 you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions
