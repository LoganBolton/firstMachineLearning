i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film what i got was scare after scare its a horror film at its core its not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore this film doesnt even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters i think one of the best things about the concept where its not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house they become haunted no matter where they are office buildings police stations hotel rooms etc after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didnt like this film i am going to see it again this week and am excited about itbr br i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should it scared the st out of me
