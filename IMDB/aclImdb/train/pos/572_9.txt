in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jesss brother here is my responsebr br the role of jesss brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story craig sheffernorman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jesss brother turned out there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when jesss brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffers character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
