it is said that david lynchs films and shorts wont appeal to everyone neither will dumbland maybe more than ever i have a feeling that dumbland as people come across it will be a true mark of i get it or what the hell its not surrealism exactly but absurd to the point of no return its also very very very stupid but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is and this selfconsciousness is a plus not a detraction br br its just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts the kind that might not even make it on hertzfeldt and judges animation show which i might add lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work centered on a lummox with an iq of 20 who has a constantly quiveringwithfear wife and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man andor an alien the episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill a salesman who can recite the gettysburg address watching over a sick brother in law ant hallucinations and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around all the while lynch is still experimenting as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off inland empirebr br for one thing hes going back to the roots of his very first short six figures getting sick six times in the usage of repetition as a means to an end this sometimes works excruciatingly well and sometimes not sometimes like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect and even an episode like with the guys friend coming over is funny moreso for the beavis  butthead comparison both laugh like idiots and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep what ends up working is how lynch shows up front delirious abstractions in the crudest ways imaginable and excessive violence br br in what comes closest to surrealism in ants the guy mistakenly sprays bugspray just called kill one of lynchs very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions on himself and envisions ants in a musical chorus line solos included and one of the most harrowingly funny things ive ever seen from the filmmaker is get the stick where we just see the guy cheered on by his son getting a stick lodged in his mouth soon the neck breaks eyes pop out and once said stick is removed he doesnt watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices and its drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foulmouthed language mostly from the man as well as from the grandmother who in one of lynchs voices for the characters is the deepest of all and a shaky quality thats reminiscent of the cream of the crop from early hertzfeldtbr br all the same im still not sure if dumbland is something i would put into someones hands if they havent seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him there are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in lynchs mind closer than we usually think to those in real life however in general theres not a whole lot that should be read into it which is why id say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion those who dig the bottomless pits of animated comedy be prepared have a blast
