im gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this however the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies its definitely something that most people will not get as is the nature of absurdismbr br the animation is horrible but yes thats the point the main character is foul mouthed violent and stupid no redeeming qualities whatsoever his wife shrieks and wails apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills most of these stories completely lack any kind of pointbr br but again thats the point br br if non sequiters foul language and complete and utter randomness are your thing youre going to love thisbr br it is really short so i would probably rent instead of buying
