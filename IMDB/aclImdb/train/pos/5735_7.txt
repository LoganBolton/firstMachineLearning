this is a short crudely animated series by david lynch as it says in the beginning and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods overallwearing large man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes and theres no real plot to be seen its easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd slightly macabre looney tunes with far more gore profanity bloody violence and occasional moments of hilaritybr br i bought the dvd along with eraserhead having previously seen eraserhead dont look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece this is anything but in fact it seems to almost be a statement against such things as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see as lynch says if this is funny it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all
