ive always enjoyed films that depict life as it is life sometimes has boring patches no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending a river runs through it is the perfect name for this film and norman macleans novel life ebbs and flows like a river and it has its rough spots but it is a wonderful tripbr br robert redford brings a lot to the film his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers i dont know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyns performances except that they truly feel real a river runs through it is a wonderful filmbr br 86 out of 10
