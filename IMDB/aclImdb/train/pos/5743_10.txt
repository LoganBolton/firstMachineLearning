i loved this movie it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting i was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying rays twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event but toms character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is a great movie dont miss it
