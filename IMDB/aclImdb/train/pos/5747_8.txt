if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it br br its in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded mentally challenged man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child its not pleasant materialbr br however its a good movie and the acting is good too the story will sit with you awhilebr br dominick is the mentallydisabled guy and is played by tom hulce i think this might be hulces best role ever hes looked after by a med student eugene played by ray liotta who became a star the following year with kevin costners field of dreamsbr br dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads hulk comic books and loves wrestling hes the type of slow guy that you cant help but love and root for to live a happy life when he freaks out its for several good reasons andwell see the film for the whole story its worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see
