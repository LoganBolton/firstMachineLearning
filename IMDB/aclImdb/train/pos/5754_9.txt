i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight i must have found the characters round because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie and the ending now thats sad well for a 78 year old kidbr br i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately and found that the plot was too simple the character twodimensional i guess its the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child pitybr br i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids  i saw it in its original french version so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not
