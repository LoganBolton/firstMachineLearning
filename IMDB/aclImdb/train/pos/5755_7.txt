this is a pretty strange movie it does comes across as an exploitation film with overthetop violence and unrealistic situations but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other as opposed to an invading otherbr br the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veterans in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous psycopaths kris kristoffersons last line is i aint lost a war yet as he meets his demise after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction including the towns chief of police and his brothers girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene however kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with a surprising depth vincent is clearly the golden boy but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73 where jimmy stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against himbr br the movie has bmovie grade action though the presence of kristofferson vincent a gorgeous victoria principal and bernadette peters give it an agrade lineupbr br i give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an american psyche of postvietnamprereagan introspection paranoia and confusion and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that timebr br seen on the this channel a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s regardless of political bent
