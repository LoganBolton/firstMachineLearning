this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 1970s it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today the story is about a vietnam vet kris kristofferson being recruited by his brother janmichael vincent to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of its great seeing kris play against type bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars janmichael shows real movie star persona in this film i dont think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv its a great flick for guys who like movies
