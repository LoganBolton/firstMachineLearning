great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitts character interviewing the presidentor pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to usscenes like those would have kept the audience awakecutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like thosethe dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watchingalsobig fans of fisingearly 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well
