i have to admit to enjoying bad movies i love them i watch all of them horror especially my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usualbr br the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the aboveground layers bulldozed and the other underground layers are simply covered up the inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave this wakes up some zombiesbr br from this point on its chunkcity the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits rollbr br ok its not great art but this one with its injoke dialogue and overthetop gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening actually it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people there are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like brendan frazer he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip
