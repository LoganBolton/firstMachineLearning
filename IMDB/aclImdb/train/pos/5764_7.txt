i originally reviewed this film on amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and blasted it i believe i called it wretched and a turkey okay well by most standards its still a turkey its got almost no production values what little plot there is makes almost no sense and the acting is on the level of a thirdgrade play that said this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic in fact all of director todd sheets films have had this effect theyre almost like ed wood in that regard watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines continuity errors same zombie two different locations and other flawsbr br ill say this sheets is a very nice guy and while this one of his first productions isnt that great he has gotten better and i must add that the only really decent actoractress in the film is kasey rousch though i may be biased as i attended school with her
