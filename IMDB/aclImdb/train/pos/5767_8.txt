so todd sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shotonvideo zepic zombie bloodbath to be his first feature film anyone whos ever seen a little beauty called zombie rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is i mean what makes this one that much more superior well then again zombie rampage doesnt include that mullet guy now does it br br for one to comprehend exactly why zombie bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90s were like for lovers of bad horror a decade that all but said goodbye to b and zcinema as we knew it technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the sovs bigboxed golden years and anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too selfaware for its own good basically defeating the purpose luckily not everyone changes with the times enter zombie bloodbathbr br and i guess this is the part where i explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years alright so some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesheating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gorescenes of the 90s the first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkwardsounding conversations you could imagine conversations that let you know that this isnt just a lowbudget zombie flick this is a zgrade disasterpiece fella plenty hysterical nonexistent acting to go around and that goes triple for mr mullet that guy is truly the highlight of the nightbr br the fact that todd sheets seriously considers zombie bloodbath to be that superior to zombie rampage amuses me to no end i mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is redneck zombies so obviously todd sheets is in the company of awsomeness by 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a fullblast spoof but mr sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless god bless todd sheets for anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90s bhorror leif jonkers darkness should be at the top of your list as for zombie bloodbath if youre a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 then 93 would be the perfect time to pick up 810
