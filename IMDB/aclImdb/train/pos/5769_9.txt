will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets lets give you 30000 to make a movie and see what you come up with the guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free sure the acting is laughable at times yes the makeup is not greatest youll ever see but its not the worst either if you want to see that go watch zombie nation with its raccoon zombiesbr br this is pure good old fashioned guerilla filmmaking todd is a consummate professional and an all around nice guy there are holes in the plot yes the plot does seem farfetched but what the hell i still love this movie i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to if anyone has ever tried to make a movie they know that just finishing it is an achievement in and of itself
