cmon people look at the title lol i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago its a great cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie lol and youll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and its midday and sunny bloody hilarious you can tell they just didnt care about plot they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible bottom line youll love it if you love 70s schlock
