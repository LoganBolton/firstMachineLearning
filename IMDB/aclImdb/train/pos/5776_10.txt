one of my alltime favorite solaughablylousythatitstotallylovable el cheapo and stinko nickelndime independent horror creature features an enjoyably dreadful marvel that was released by the formidably fecund exploitation outfit crown international pictures so it could play numerous crappy double bills at countless driveins back in the 70s and eventually wound up being rerun like crazy on several smalltime secondary cable stations throughout the 80s i naturally first saw this gloriously ghastly abomination on latenight television one fateful saturday evening while in my early teens and have had a deepseated albeit completely irrational abiding fondness for it ever sincebr br a meteorite falls out of the sky and crashes into the still waters of a tranquil country lake thereby causing a heretofore dormant dinosaur egg to hatch of course the baby dino immediately grows into a gigantic waddling grunting teethgnashing prehistoric behemoth with goofy flippers an extended neck and a huge mouth full of little sharp jagged stalagmitelike chompers our southernfried male cousin to the loch ness monster promptly starts chowing down on various luckless local yokel residents of a previously quiet and sleepy hillbilly resort town its up to drippy stalwart sheriff richard cardella assisted by the painfully idiotic hayseed comic relief brotherly fishing guide duo of glenn roberts and mark seigel feisty gal pal kacey cobb and terminally insipid nerdy scientist bob hyman to get to the bottom of things before the oversized gluttonous jurassic throwback ruins the tourist trade by eating all the campers and fisherman that the hick hamlet makes its cash off ofbr br directorcoscreenwriter william r stromberg displays a wonderfully woeful and thoroughly clueless incompetence when it comes to pacing atmosphere taut narrative construction and especially eliciting sound credible acting from his hopelessly allthumbs rank amateur community theater level cast the performances are uniformly abysmal cardella is way too bland and wooden to cut it as a solid heroic lead while the pitifully dopey redneck comic antics of roberts and seigel provoke groans of slackjawed disbelief  you arent laughing with these two atrociously mugging clods so much as at them particularly when the insufferable imbeciles discover a severed head bobbing up and down in the murky lake water better yet a clumsily integrated subplot concerning a vicious ontheloose criminal leads to a spectacularly hamfisted supermarket holdup scene which degenerates into a hilariously stupid minimassacre when a young lady shopper interrupts the stickup artist in midrobbery a subsequent car chase is likewise severely bungled as well its so limply staged and unimpressive that one feels more relieved than scared when the monster abruptly pops up to devour the nefarious fugitive moreover david allens funky herkyjerky stop motion animation dinosaur is the authentic gnarly article projecting a certain raw charisma sneaky reptilian personality and overall forceful screen presence which makes all the horrendously underwhelming human characters seem like pathetically unbecoming nobody bores in comparison and as for the rousing conclusion where the sheriff takes on our slavering beastie with a bulldozer the operative word for this thrilling confrontation is boffo all the way
