despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash the opening in which cavepaintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red herring after that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg maybe the cavepaintings suggest instead that this isnt the first time such a thing has happened when the prehistoric beast appears its a wellanimated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area alright so its not jurassic park but its still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies
