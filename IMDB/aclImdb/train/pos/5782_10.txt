the internet database lists this as a tv show and yes it was a series on mtv shown on the oddities program after the head and before aeon flux if i recall correctly but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutesbr br you have the story of the maxx julie winters sarah and mr gone the maxx is a superhero or a bum julie a social worker or a leopard queen sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr gone a guy who cant seem to keep his head on and then theres the other weird creaturesbr br i use or with maxx and julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams maybe theyre all real or dreams maybe one of the characters doesnt exist maybe only one exists and dreams of the others youll have to wait and find outbr br i had the comic books before the show came out and it was one of my favorites the artwork was spectacular and the story was original  unlike anything youll find in superman or batman it will bend your mind and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive and the show used basically the same exact artwork only now it moves and the same story guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced this was the best show to appear on oddities hands downbr br if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip this is a show to check out its donnie darko before there was ever such a thingbr br the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series but i dont say this in disappointment by keeping it simple they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures
