ive read reviews of kerching on imdb and franklyive not seen one positive review until now i actually like kerching kerching is about a teenage boy named taj lewis in order to make £1000000 for his mother he sets up a website called rudeboy the website offers a lot of interesting things if only taj and his 2 friends  danny and seymour can stop taj from getting exposed i find this show quite funny and i enjoy watching it the acting is ok but it can definitely be better the characters are funny especially danny spooner tajs friend  his stupidity is what makes him funny and tajs other friend seymour also carlton the owner of the cafée called the chill we never see him we only hear him tajs younger brother omar and his older sister missy is funny too and missys best friend kareesha so many times tajs has almost got exposed almost as well as the comedy the drama in kerching such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this programme great
