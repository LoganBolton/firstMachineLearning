ive noticed that a lot of people who post on the kerching board seem to hate this show which i actually find very surprising i think its one of the best british kids shows there is its a shame its ending because its very funny if a bit cheesy sometimes and has great characters the main character is a little like del boy although quite a lot smarter with his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of rudeboy his friends are seymour who likes to cook and danny who is simple minded and the comic relief character throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but its always been entertaining and improving
