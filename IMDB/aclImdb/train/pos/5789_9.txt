this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing sandy and the agnes moorheadandthetinyspacemen episodesbr br it is an important take from mid1961 on the long cold war that the us was then embroiled in the beatendown cityscene the nearstarving characters sparse dialog their threadbare uniforms and the minimal action says it all the absurdity of an ongoing conflict that threatens to destroy human life modern civilization and all that is sweet and redeeming about itbr br it is a fable because it was made in a time in which had events turned out differently such as the second berlin crisis spring 1961 and the subsequent cuban missile crisis oct 1962 it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the uss major cities ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors i also see it as a fable because it is not only a cautionary tale but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths it is a love story set in an impossible situation and involving two highly mismatched lovers
