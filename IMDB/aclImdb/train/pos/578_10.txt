there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except  as jesse says  its the berries all of page ones commentators wrote eloquently  as almost so as the dialog is in this movie this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actorsactresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lostbr br i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens the churchs pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev maclean did in his church that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches  no holyrollering in my church it was a big church with many different programs to keep its congregation busy  the most inspiring perhaps was the musicdepartment with its huge choir and almost classical anthems too the sunday eveningcongregation was almost entirely younger people are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night how i wish it still was  watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the openspace beauties of montana  yet arent there also missilesilos there too flyfishing or any other activity which draws familymembers closer together for a happy life  and deep understanding of one another  becomes a blessing although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it speakeasies and prostitutes are counterbalanced by the simple gatherings of oldfashioned community picnics as this movie contains  in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer this is the third film ive seen in which tom skeritt  plays a father all different styles and brilliantly actedbr br brad pitt mostly an undiscovered talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the castmembers deserved many awards little stories superbly told will get 10of10 from me over any movie with violence foul language ugliness and action i am thinking particularly of crash and most of arnolds movies what a savior for peace this movie is
