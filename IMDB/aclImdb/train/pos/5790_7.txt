wow all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy she speaks russian then im surrendering right now in her short skirt hightop boots and pronounced bust line shes a real babe even if her zombielike eyeshadow sort of comes and goes this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin ruining all the fun okay probably i should leave off my hormonal responsebr br this is a very well produced halfhour by that underrated force behind the seriess success buck houghton naturally the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry its post nuclearholocaust america we know because shes part of the invading force and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage they wander among the destruction in alternating moods while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics which of course it eventually does lucky bronson and thats about it no real talk except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown nonetheless the screenplay is still entertaining and rather daring for its time even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers a popular cold war stereotype of the timebr br in passing its rather curious that the very slaviclooking bronson buchinsky would be cast as the american and the glossylooking montgomery as the slav appearancewise it should be the reverse my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female regardless of appearances however that may be there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere still the episode remains a very very watchable 30 minutes
