this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a postapocalyptic environmentbr br the cobwebstrewn shops and rubbleladen streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does bestbr br while the parable can be a bit heavyhanded by todays drama standards it is an excellent one  using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience as well as geopolitics in a way that is timeless the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr bronson and ms montgomery who do not disappoint may they both rest in peacebr br a true classic
