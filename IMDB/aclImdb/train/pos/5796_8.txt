moonwalker is a fantasy music film staring michael jackson with different segments i will rate each segment individuallybr br segment 1 opens the film with a music video the music video is a concert of michael jackson performing the song man in the mirror the music video also shows montages of historical figures such as gandhi martin luther king jr john lennon and more the first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures i even loved the message in the song i give the first segment a 910br br segment 2 shows a montage of michael jacksons start from the jackson five to his solo career the montage i thought was well made i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as i i want you back beat it thriller can you feel it and the way you make me feel the only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is we are the world the reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of michael jackson and the chorus of the celebrities but its a little hard to see the chorus other than that the segment is still good i give it a 910br br segment 3 is the song bad youre probably thinking its michael jacksons music video of badwell yes and no this segment is the music video but its redone by kids the segment was cute but it wasnt as good as the other segments i give it a 610br br segment 4 is a short claymation music film that takes place after the kids version of bad called speed demon the short is about michael jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them the claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people also at the end of the clip out of nowhere michael jackson rabbit costume comes to life and hes dancing with it i liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere i give it a 810br br segment 5 is michael jacksons grammy winning music video leave me alone the music video is about the media poking their nose at michael jacksons personal life and michael jackson feels they wont leave him alone no matter how much hes proved innocent the music video really speaks out but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80s but i didnt feel this video should be in this movie because its a kids movie and i dont think kids will understand what hes singing about i give this music video 810br br segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called smooth criminal michael jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children  including john lennons son sean lennon from an evil mobster named mr bigg played by joe pesci the segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song smooth criminal with a bunch of criminals i also thought the special effects were good the weird thing about the segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why also joe pesci character talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them i mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film other wise it was good my rating for this segment is a 810br br segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie the film ends with michael jackson singing a cover version of the beatles song come together and then during the credits we see michael jackson singing with ladysmith black mambazo michael did a good cover of come together and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singers with a talented musican like him my rating is 910br br this movie is a good michael jackson film i think it really brings out children s imagination the film is almost as imaginative as the beatles animated movie yellow submarine if you like michael jackson and youre up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film my overall rating for this movie is 810
