and i dont say it in a bad waybr br i watched this movie at the cinema when i was 6 or 7 for me and my cousins it was magical beautiful and scary at the same time when we left the theatre michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about itbr br over the years i saw this movie being aired a few times but i always changed the channel even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart and i liked it that waybr br so ive only seen this movie once and i believe it was a good decision not to watch it again if i saw it today i know i couldnt help but criticise mjs acting the plot if there was one and this and that for me this is a childhood memory so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years agobr br i see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music for that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though this is definitely worthy of a 10
