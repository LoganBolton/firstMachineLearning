moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if youre not a michael jackson fan im a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasnt fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were  if youre a fanbr br i personally believe the first 50 minutes are rewatchable many times over the dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertainingbr br it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos it also includes some live concert footagebr br if youre a big fan of michael jackson this is a must if youre not a fandont like michael jackson steer well clearbr br 910
