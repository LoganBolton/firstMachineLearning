this movie is greatbr br now i do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue but now and then something like moonwalker comes along and its watchable despite numerous flawsbr br this film is no more than a highly entertaining michael jackson advertisement beginning with sickly video set to man in the mirror a montage listing his achievements and bits and bobs from his career it goes through all the highs of his life then crashes down into a really really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for bad and speed demon following the adventures of mj as he runs from manic stopmotion fans and finally dancing against a rabbit costume the stop motion isnt that bad as some would have you believe its passablebr br then we see the great video for leave me alone and straight into the main featurebr br yes the plot is laughable very laughable we see michael walk out of a building then get shot at by thousands of troops then we hit flashback showing mj and three children stumbling upon an underground lair mr big joe pesci is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on drugs no specifics are mentioned at an early age mj and the little girl he is with get caught then chased yada yada yada the plot isnt really the important part we get two very cool sequences where mj turns into a car then a robotspaceship thing and of course the amazing smooth criminal sequencebr br its a soso film but it is fantastic for anyone who likes mj it has most of his greatest hits and some cool little bits and some quite good special effects the robotspaceship sequence in particular worth it especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay itll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released
