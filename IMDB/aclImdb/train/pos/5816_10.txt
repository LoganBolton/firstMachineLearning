the first time i saw this film i loved it when i was 11 i was more interested in the music and dancing as ive grown older ive become more interested in the acting as well while the first half is just a retrospective of michaels career from the jackson 5 up to bad it was still entertaining to watch the badder sequence couldve been left out though the kids were pretty good speed demon and leave me alone were funny especially when the police officer tells michael i need your autograph right here after stopping him for dancing in a nodancing zone but its smooth criminal thats the icing on the cake joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie and that hair was wild the dancing is perfect and so are the special effects the only thing i could have done without was the spiders any fan of michaels should see this if you havent already i give it a 10
