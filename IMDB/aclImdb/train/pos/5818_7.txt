actually this movie has silly moments both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part and its much worse than other mj movies like the wiz captain eo and ghosts but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years yeah thats half my life you guys i cant complain too much about it just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me but as a movie its not good at all and im afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling mike hadnt been the one starring in it but since no one but mike is the moonwalker it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me
