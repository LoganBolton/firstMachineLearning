ah moonwalker im a huge michael jackson fan i grew up with his music thriller was actually the first music video i ever saw apparently believe it or not there was a time where michael jackson was like a god to people a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him sorry michael but moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of michaels success of the time right when he released his famous bad album that was record breaking was the first album to have 6 top ten singles michael is an incredible artist there is no doubt he writes sings dances but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his audienceÂ… not so muchbr br we start off pretty simple jacksons music life career success and the mania that was the 80s biggest star in the world michael jackson later on jackson is a 30s style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children when jackson was allowed to be near children we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog the dog runs away and in their search for it jackson and the children uncover the lair of mr big frankie lideo a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace of planet earth addicted to drugs starting with the children mr big discovers jackson and the children but they escape jackson tells the children to meet him at club 30s which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the 1930s the story goes back to the mobsters attack on jackson and here it is revealed that jackson is actually a magical gangster who draws his power from shooting stars as one passes by the club jackson transforms into a sports car and mows down several of mr bigs henchmen the story picks up on the children at club 30s and at first the children are afraid but when jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the 1930s the club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers jackson participates in a danceoff with the other club members which serves as the music video for smooth criminal at the climax of the song mr big lays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children katie jackson follows them back to bigs lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen mr big appears and mentally tortures jackson by threatening to inject katie with highly addictive narcotics while katie manages to just grab joe pescis glasses and get free from being injected mr big decides hes had enough and orders his men to kill katie before finishing off jackson but not before a shooting star flies by jackson transforms into a giant robot and kills all of mr bigs soldiers yup ummm you want more weirdness watch the moviebr br moonwalker is fun for the first half hour seeing michaels success and all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again is it mostly to hype up his album yeah i love how he spends the first 25 minutes praising how awesome he is then we go to his song called leave me alone which is kind of hypocritical not that its not a great song just a small turn of events then when we skip the crummy acting the story was incredibly weak the villain spells his name out loud while michael and katie are spying on him lol michael is a transformer all of a sudden the villains big monster plan is to make kids high also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make marvin the martian blush but if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for smooth criminal this music video is perfection its choreographing its setting its song its smooth style michael always goes above and beyond perfection and smooth criminal was incredible i loved moonwalker as a kid i still watch it for fun to this day but its not the best movie by any means its pretty silly but its all good if youre a michael jackson fan as wellbr br 710
