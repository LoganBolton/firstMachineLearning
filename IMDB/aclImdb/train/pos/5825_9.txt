most stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges short bar none and theyre right curly is a scream dressed up in drag as senorita cucaracha and moe and larry are in top form as senor mucho and senor gusto respectively christine mcintyres beautiful operatic voice is given full reinshe actually was a trained opera singerand its wonderful the great gino corrado is hilarious as a pompous italian singer terrorized by the stooges at a society party some truly funny gags good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the stooges prolific output whats even more amazing is that curly was having severe health problems at the time and in several of the shorts he made during this period you can see that he is obviously ill his timing is way off he speaks very slowly and haltingly and has trouble getting around fortunately his health was in an upswing when he made this film and it shows classic stooge comedy and enjoyed by even nonstooge fans i had a girlfriend who couldnt stand the stooges but even she laughed at this one a mustsee
