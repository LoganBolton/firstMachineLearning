as a habit i always like to read through the hated it reviews of any given movie especially one that id want to comment on and its not so much a pointcounterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipsidebr br however i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase beautiful but shallow some even going so far as to say that norms desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at bestbr br id like to disagreebr br as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to selfdestruction and its not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks its really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully selfdestructive its a lot like people like howard hughes Â— the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and whats worse you realize you cant do a damn thing about itbr br for norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all
