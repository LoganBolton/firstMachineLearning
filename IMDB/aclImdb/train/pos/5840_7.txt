while the premise of the film is pretty lame ollie is diagnosed with hornophobia the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick its also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this oneprobably since this was the last hal roachproduced laurel and hardy film in fact it wouldnt be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathossomething true laurel and hardy films never would do they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lackbr br stan and ollie work at a horn factory this sounds pretty funny but it isnt not surprisingly with all the racket ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work the doctor james finlaysonin his last film with the team recommends an ocean voyage however they dont like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dockthen they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother once they are on the boat a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea fortunately this portion of the film actually was wellpaced and the very end worked out very wellbr br while not a great fulllength laurel and hardy film it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers like in the devils brother or babes in toyland additionally there is still a decent amount of physical comedysomething you would see almost none of after this film part of this was due to the boys declining health and ollies increasing girth and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films
