i enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate from reading other comments here i suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a fullsize screen in the cinema in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience i was lucky enough to have that experience borne up on ripples of laughter from all around and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedybr br for it is as a comedy that it shines if it shines anywhere at all the music is nothing special  in fact i hadnt realised it was a musical and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into halfspoken lyric  but i do have to admit that the halfthreat halfpromise of oh what ill do has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time as its still going round and round in my headbr br the plot such as it is largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous francesca a sixteenthcentury portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and furcoat her idea on the sanctity of marriage dont quite jibe with those of her distant descendant the countess angelina and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the production code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her muchdelayed marriagebed with the right manbr br the romance is scarcely earthshattering and in fact the first few scenes played pretty well straight verge on the tedious but where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows the impudence of douglas fairbanks jrs courtship of betty grables married angelina is equalled only by bettygrableasfrancescas pursuit of him in turn culminating in complete rolereversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she  literally  sweeps him off his feet this is probably the comic climax of the plot although the consequences of the colonels understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two acts of the operettastructure and the spectacle of fairbanks blissful bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its ownbr br grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters wisely gets almost all the limited singing opportunities and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned but in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose setup and humour is worthy of the silent screenbr br this film is too uneven in style to be a classic varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium but at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up out of tune with its times it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences  but on this showing really didnt deserve to be disowned by both grable and preminger the uncredited director this is no masterpiece but a thoroughly entertaining minor work and i for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home
