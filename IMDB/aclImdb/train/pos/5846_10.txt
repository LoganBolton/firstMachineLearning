it was on at 730am too close to school to see very often the animation  computer graphics were spectacular for the time the idea of cowboys  ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles  robots was amazing maybe it inspired treasure planetbr br unfortunately its really boring in the dvd format the shows are all basically identical when viewing nonsequential episodes on a dvd youre stoned by disk 3 by todays standards the animation is spotty we dont notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are insteadbr br the bright spots are the heroine characters they were a lot more believable took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and werent corny they actually saved men
