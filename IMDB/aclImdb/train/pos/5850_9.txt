it has been 16 years since its original run i would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to rerelease the original 65 episodes i cant fathom why the scifi or cartoon network havent snapped this up galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better scriptsthe animation was above average quality for its time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today it predated the heavy toontoy tie in market this may have sealed its doom too i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available
