this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay spiderman improves in both departments it also features the voice of stan lee the creator of spiderman comicsbr br as youd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can he does more than spin webs in fact he uses them as weapons and shields when hes not using web in combat he punches and kicks as well spidey has his hands full as he battles venom rhino mysterio scorpion and dr octopus to name a few look for captain america in a cameobr br most of the levels are challenging but some of them require patience to beat the only complaint about this game is that its so short and can be completed in less than three hours if youre a real marvel superhero fan this game is for you but dont expect long gameplay better luck in spiderman 2 my evaluation 9 out of 10
