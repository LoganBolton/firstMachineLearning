overall i agree wholly with eberts review in a sense i feel that i should not even be commenting since it is so much a vets movie and i am not a vet i was a resister the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently my guess is that stephen metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character
