i loved this movie it is rare to get a glimpse of postpartum vietnam and this moviesans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire did it i had no idea id be so affected by it what an amazing look at how alien vets feel it was tough to watch quite frankly we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama but this is so so different what happens when they come back and try to live a life they cant it made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in america not able to relate cant sleep cant have love affairs cant deal with normal society they feel totally apart this is a huge tragedy and one that isnt addressed enough yeah weve changed our attitude about vietnam vets we like them now but so what it doesnt seem to have made any difference to them its too late so it was a great film but i cried a lot i have no other criticisms
