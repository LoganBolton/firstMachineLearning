this wouldve been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for john abraham this guy is an awful actor be it comedy drama tearjerkers etc he stinks it seemed like at some point priyadarshan realized this too and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his soloscenes a bit funnybr br hes the only noticeable drawbackthere are a couple more annoying tidbits of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise best comedy to come along in bollywood since hungama imo like hungama its a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of courseakshay kumar this is probably his best performance to date he better be a shoein for best comedian at every award function aks always been good at comedy but he takes it to a different level here the body language the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line its a genius performance the packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and i dont think ive ever seen such an atmosphere for a bollywood movie here in usabr br garam masala doesnt have one lead heroine it stars 3 incredibly hotbeautiful girls who i thought did a fairly good job pretty sure they are all making their debuts paresh rawal is solid as usual although his routine wears itself out after a while rajpal yadav is his typical annoying selfsick of his overthetop act in every movie rimi sen has nothing to dobr br overall definitely worth a dekho id say its funnier than no entry and thats saying a lot couldve been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than john abrahambr br 810
