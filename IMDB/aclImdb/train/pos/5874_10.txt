this move was friggin hilarious funniest ive seen in a while akshay and john kick ass as always and the chicks are hot too the story is awesome lots of great jokes and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldnt understand the humor u moron dont rate movies u dont understand what did u watch the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation thats what i thought jackass br br akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility he can do not only action but comedy as well and is excellent at it john has proved himself as well this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it
