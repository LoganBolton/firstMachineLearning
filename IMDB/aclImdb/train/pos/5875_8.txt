these are one of the movies that dont require any brain or thinking its a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so i was really surprised with john abrahams acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless faceso from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfullyby managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as paresh rawal and akshaye kumar i was also quite surprised with the akshayes 3 girls because there roles dont require much talent but mostly moaning about akshayes dissapearenceto the other girls i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing also majority of songs are goodit is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood
