really i liked it the premise was good the story fit where both respective series left off and heres my favorite part mary and valerie arent bitter they arent like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible reunions a prime example is susan dey the partridge family in fact valerie was saying that shed be thrilled to do another movie and then mary said the same thing later so i would be on the look for anotherbut if that doesnt quite work out then they can rerun this one
