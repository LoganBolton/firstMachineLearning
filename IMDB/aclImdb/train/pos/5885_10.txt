this movie pretty much surprised me i didnt have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary  rhoda was very funny and well written they didnt spend too much time rehashing the past so they werent relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very entertainingbr br my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sitcom and i think i might agree with her
