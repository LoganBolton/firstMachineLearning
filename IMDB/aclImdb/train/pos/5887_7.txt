so mary and rhoda have agedwho hasnt i was a teen when mary premiered and a young adult when it left the air yes it was great to see mary and rho together and yes maybe the film didnt sustain the comedy of the original series but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute example the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about old people isnt this typical of the mentality of presentday hollywood tv and film bean counters this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its bestbut its a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s
