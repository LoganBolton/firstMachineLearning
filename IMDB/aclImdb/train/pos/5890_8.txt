the italian is among the great or neargreat films of 1915 that are available today the year was a turning point for the featurelength film especially in america lois webers hypocrites cecil b demilles the cheat and of course dw griffiths the birth of a nation set new benchmarks for the art additionally that year russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures after death and daydreams the french serial les vampires also has its admirers today although i disagree with them the emergence of the featurelength film was led by europe mainly denmark france and italy but dominance of this market and to a degree the art shifted to across the atlantic in 1915br br the most overriding artistic achievement of the italian is its stunning and often innovative cinematography there are some picturesque sunsets mobile framing including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car and in general there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout an especially amazing shot is a closeup of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme closeup in reference to dw griffiths musketeers of pig alley 1912 hes so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his angerbr br unfortunately the cinematographer appears to be unknown the director although originally without credit in the film is now known to have been reginald barker five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today but are rather unremarkable civilization 1916 which he worked on was a large production but a deeply flawed movie by the way id guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on civilization also photographed the italianbr br moreover the entire production is very advanced for then venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles for romanticized venice and san francisco for the ethnic slums of new york there are extensive flashbacks although perhaps one or two too many i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor george beban who is also the lead in the inner main narrative the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes à la the theatre which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the childs room with the opening and closing of window curtains parallel editing incamera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly additionally beban and clara williams as his wife play their parts wellbr br on the other hand the italian does have a few drawbacks the films early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works wellmostly because its supported by the lighting and photography the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film enhanced by the stark photography must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the moviegoing public back then the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italians revenge in addition the filmmakers were either medically naïf or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child aside from the deficiencies in plot the italian is exceptionally well made
