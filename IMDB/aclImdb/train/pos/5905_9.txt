this is a really well made movie sumitra bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her this movie should have won the national award and would have been my pick to represent india at the oscars it is at least a thousand times better than shaaws which is going to the oscars from india this yearbr br it is such a pity that the information about this and all other indian movies on imdb is lacking and sometimes even wrong sadashiv amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages the rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when sonali kulkarni won the indian national award for this movie there was not even a single vote cast for doghibr br doghi is not a hindi movie it is marathi and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and halfwitted designer ware it is a real life soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respectbr br doghi which can roughly be translated as two women is a story of two sisters gauri and krishna it is actually a very simple story sumitra bhave does not venture into many sub plots and that makes it a very difficult film to direct the entire movie is set in a nondescript remote village in maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists no aesthetic sunsets in this onebr br the movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house which is preparing for gauris wedding gauri and krishnas father being a hard working farmer the house is full and happy there is nothing wanting in their simple lives however on the eve of the wedding gauris tobehusband meets with a fatal accident gauris father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke without a strong working member the house could have fallen apart but gauris mother shoulders the responsibility she works as and when she can but cannot make ends meet but her life still is easier than gauris superstitions that people halfheartedly try to forget make gauri an evil luck bringer she is outcast from the societybr br gauris mother writes to her brother desperate for help she accepts his suggestion he takes gauri off to mumbai where she is made to work in brothels gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve gauri gives her life for that of her familysbr br however when gauri returns home for krishnas wedding her mother does not come out to meet her she does not allow krishna near her and does not allow gauri in front of the guests she loves gauri but fears for krishnas life this breaks gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life but krishna runs out and holds gauri she begs her beloved sister to return krishna promises to stand by her promises that they would face the world  togetherbr br there is nothing that is not required in this movie everything is necessary and sufficient gauri goes off to mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know it just the bare story which is profound in its simplicitybr br doghi is responsible cinema it is respectful to the subject it handles it is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year oldbr br the acting is first rate the direction is marvelous  the silences carry the story forward in a way no words could have the script is well researchedbr br anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like doghi
