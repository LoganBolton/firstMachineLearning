i have read the short story by norman maclean and the movie did justice to norman macleans writing my husband tends to reread it occasionally and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind we have videos of many of redford Â‘s movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around we never get tired of redfords perception of norman maclean writings and the beauty of montana the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr macleans father according to a river runs through it methodists are baptists who can read a line which by the way is not in the short story but i think that is a funny line my husband and i are wellread baptistsbr br i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow i disagree as one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in threefour rhythm of the metronome the photography is outstanding the acting is great i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer then as adult paul played by brad pitt se7ven is the perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it the same applies to neal burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace finally after hours they all kneel around the table to say grace and they all leave but the oatmeal stayed on the plate that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors that is funny the sunburn the drive back home where jessie burns emily lloyd decides to go via the train line beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with himbr br redford himself does a superb job as a narrator i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford barefoot in the park the nominated director producer actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece the river to me means that line that separates life from death memories and realities redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it
