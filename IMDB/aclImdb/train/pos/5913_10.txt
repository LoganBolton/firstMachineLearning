coonskin might be my favorite ralph bakshi film like the best of his work its inyourface and not ashamed of it for a second but unlike some of his other work even when hes at his finest which was before and after coonskin with heavy traffic and wizards its not much uneven despite appearances to the contrary bakshis taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race of course but moreover hes making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film blaxploitation almost though bakshi doesnt stop just there if it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature but bakshis aims are higher throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but italiansmafioso homosexuals jews overall new yorktypes in the urban quarters of manhattan in the 70s he isnt out to make anything realistic the most normal looking creation in looking drawn real is in fact a naked woman painted red white and bluebr br in mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism ie the tarrabbit baby joke yes joke plus blackface were looking at abstraction to a grand degree and best of all bakshi doesnt take himself too seriously unlike spike lee with a film like bamboozled in delivering his message this is why for the most part coonskin is a hilarious piece of work where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and of course scenes of awkward behavior i loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the reallife white couple in tux and dress as looking colorful and the like are just too much not to laugh at its not just the imagery which is in and of itself incredibly overstylized but that the screenplay is sharp and this is key for bakshi this time considering its got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madnessbr br using at first liveaction then animation and then an extremely clever matching of the two ironically what bakshi later went for in commercial form with cool world is done here to a t with less money and a rougher edge pappy and randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape and pappy tells of the story of brother rabbit who with brother bear and preacher fox go to harlem and become bigtime hoodlums with rabbit in direct opposition to a jabbathehutesquire godfather character this is obviously a take off on song of the south with its intentionally happygolucky plot and animation here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really isbr br yet bakshi goes for broke in combining forms animated characters stand behind and move along with liveaction backgrounds when violence and gunshots and fights occurs its as bloody as it can get for 1975 when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in blackface and a dress he trips in a manner of which not even disney could reach with dumbo a boxing match with brother bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slowmotion archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies some and some from the 20s that are just tastelessbr br like mel brooks or kubrick or more recently south park bakshis coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thoughtprovocation second its also audacious filmmaking on an independent scale everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters however all based on the theme of the piece all serve the thought in the script where its bmovie plot opens up much more for interpretation to call it racist misses the point its like calling dr strangelove proatomic desolation or confederate states of america pro slavery and for me its one of the best satires ever made
