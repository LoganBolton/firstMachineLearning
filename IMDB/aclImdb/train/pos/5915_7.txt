after finally watching walt disneys song of the south on myspace i decided to watch ralph bakshis response to that moviecoonskinon afro video which i linked from google video in this one during the liveaction sequences preacherman charles gordone takes his friend sampson barry white with him to pick up pappy scatman crothers and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name professionally as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox gordone and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts theres a mix of animation and liveaction that provides a unique pointofview from the writerdirector that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america whos a bigas in gigantic in every waywhite blonde woman dressed in skintight red white and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bears frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me theres also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a cockroach she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jrs version of aint no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the nword in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation
