i had watched this film from ralph bakshi wizards hey good lookin one night ago on wwwafrovideoorg and i didnt see anything racial i am not stupid i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today but i think its a satire and a veryvery urban retelling of the old uncle remus stories that the black american culture created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to the tar baby and the briar patch these arent bigoted stories mind you but cultural icons created by black americans and me being a white woman read and love those stories and i also found it an interesting timecapsule view on the black culture in harlem new york in the 70sbr br well to get to the nittygritty of this film this film is a liveactionanimated film which begins in liveaction with a fellow named sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem you know to me rabbitbear and fox are animal versions of randysampson and the preacherman an abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s Â— racial ethnic and otherwisebr br so anyway it is another good bakshi movie and should we sweep films like this under the rug pretend they never exist hmmmi think that would be a shame i think we should watch these films entacted and learn about what goes on back then just how far we come since then
