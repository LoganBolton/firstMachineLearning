streetfight aka coonskin is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer ralph bakshi it is an oddity of the cinema and is very much worth seeing it is live action mixed with animation seemingly influenced on disneys legendary song of the south almost as if it is a response to that flick philip michael thomas later to become don johnsons sidekick on miami vice and scatman crothers most famous for his role in kubricks the shining are prison escapees charles gordone and barry white yes that barry white are thomas friends and plan to help him escape prison they are stuck at a police roadblock and crothers tells thomas a story about a black rabbit a bear and a fox who move from the south to harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence the story is animated and provides a lot of wonderous things to see like all of bakshis films most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation true animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness the movie is very violent very sexual and it is mostly about battles between the races for a long time i thought i was watching something extremely important but after a while especially after i got done watching it it started to seem more like a runofthemill blacksploitation flick along the lines of superfly its very sloppy and doesnt really say anything besides isnt bakshi white whatever the answer to that coonskinstreetfight is still very much worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans 710
