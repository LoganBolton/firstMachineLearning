street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire this is not a movie you just watch for fun it is not a comfortable experience although it does have some laughoutloud moments this is a movie you watch when you need food for thoughtbr br to dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely this is not only a satire of song of the south its also a biting commentary on the prejudices that americans still have as a society every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people through this wild exaggeration the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightlyheld beliefs really arebr br if youre the sort of person whos willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices american culture still holds and if youre not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye this movie may be for you
