because of all the negative reviews of this film i almost didnt watch it however i was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie the acting wasnt great  apart from the wonderful alice krige  but some of the dialogue just consider yourself lunch was quite amusingbr br on the whole an above average stephen king effort  710
