monstrous mothersonduo alice krige and brian krause sucks lifeforce of virgins and their newest target is pretty but lonely tanya madchen amick however these monsters are allergic to cats scratches i have never been fan of sleazy overrated bestsellerists like king koontz or barker but this bmovie written by mr dung himself is actually not near as bad than it could be yes it is sometimes jawdroppingly atrocious but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches good oldfashioned graveyard eerie soundtrack and candlelitgothichousescene mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains etc of course the film is polluted by mr dungs pottymouthed dialogue and alltacticsoftoiletseat obsession to vilify fat people leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher but there is roses among manure
