although written by stephen king an overrated writer if there ever was one this is actually quite entertaining bmovie vampiric incestuous creatures who live in the candlelit house and drain the lifeforce of virgins great graveyard scenery heroic cats and very pretty virgin the soundtrack even has enyas music an idea which i found quite nice im sure king is disappointed to this little movie although it has crappy dialogue and ideas all of them from a true and tedious king potboiler albeit sleepwalkers if im understood right is a script without any novel or short story behind it still those touches of sewerodors show he didnt use a ghostwriter after all
