theres a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldnt direct a horror film of quality if he had to and sleepwalkersscreenplay written by stephen kingis often used as an example of this i like sleepwalkers though i fully am aware that garris just says fck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway its about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkersfelinehuman shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents moving from town to town living a nomadic existence truly powerfulset their sights on a teenager who doesnt surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother shant tolerate the possible death of her beloved sonbr br garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacherglenn shadix suspecting handsome all american charmer charles bradybrian krauseto be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles lures pretty virgins into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama maryalice krige the fresh new target is tanya robertsonmädchen amick and she seems to be easy pickens but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a strugglethanks to a deputys cat clovis marys vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying sonbr br like many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy dolenz i was smitten with mädchen amick shes simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his ulterior motives i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i wouldve welcomed her in the genre with open armsbr br krige is yummy as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanyas parents in one fail swoop in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn cob she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman before cracking his arma bone protruding knocking him unconscious with his own elbow she tosses tanyas mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her fathers face a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charlescopkebab falling on the pencil for extra impact poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans we see mary and charles abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers joe dante and john landis as photograph expertsbr br the film is shot in a tongueincheek letitallhangout manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home its about the ultraviolence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris direction and kings screenplay the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and inyourface without a lick of complexity this is closer in vein to kings own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works
