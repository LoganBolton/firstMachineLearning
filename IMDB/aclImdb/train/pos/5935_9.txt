after seeing the terrible terrible terrible batman dead end i knew i had to see this as soon as i heard about itbr br pressing play to view the trailer i thought i was in for another hideous short from what sofar looked like another bad wannabe filmmaker trying to bring new depth to an existing character but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie that sadly doesnt exist as i would love to see a finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes longbr br worlds finest makes up for batman dead end and then somebr br i look forward to the next short
