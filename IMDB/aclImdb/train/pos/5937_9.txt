after seeing the batman dead end short i didnt know what to really expect from worlds finest of course superman and batman all my worlds finest comic books have them as the teamupbr br after seeing this 3andahalf minute trailer it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for worlds finest if not an actual fulllength filmbr br sure some of the superman stuff was cheesy but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers giving you only certain aspects of the entire product this looks like it needs a complete productbr br other than director sandy colleras relative playing an achingly poor perry white most of the actors were unknown if an actual movie was made actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane especially if given closertothecharacter dialoguebr br good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s90s leather cape and cowl his demeanor is batmanlike but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie personabr br michael ohearn cannot play superman period he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says slap me and line delivery seems to be a problem with himbr br overall though i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work there was a rumor about a worlds finest movie being made and with the correct additions to the script this could be it hope more like this are made
