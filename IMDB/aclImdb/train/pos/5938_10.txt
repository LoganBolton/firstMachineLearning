another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batmandead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts the attention to detail character and action is undeniably real although this is a limited resources production it puts to shame big budgeted starcasted hyped productions other superhero related movies here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people finally a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing batman the way it should be without the flashy rubbercasted  ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that dont deliver i just wish that some sensible warner bros exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel i dont care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd i would never get tired of watching it just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this hope the bigwigs at marvel  dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look no more batman  robin fiasco or hulk daredevil etc learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldnt be any reason to reinvent the hero for the movie just to have it bomb in theaters mr collorawe need more directors like you
