batman and superman iconic the better part of a century old who doesnt know of these two there must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them sandy collora went ahead and put together a trailer for such a filmwhich does not exist and is not being created much less by this team perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is throughout the cinematography is solid the editing is spoton the production values even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character are quite high it looks quite hollywood this trailer the physical types fit for as far as i can tell every single character the lines are reasonably written the shots are wellthought up nicely achieved and fairly effective however this does have problems and in spite of looking good it doesnt quite match the energy and skill of graysonwhich only had the problem of teetertottering too much back and forth between a short and a trailer as well as unbridled passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas the acting is perhaps the most evident its not good even some of those who only have one line andor hardly appear onscreen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance the actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters theyre playing than their talent then there is the writing really the plot well what minuscule amount there isthis and this character team up something about some evil plot is fine there is a problem in the characterization while most characters seem to fit twoface is well about as much as a cackling lunaticwhich is quite simply as far as ive understood not what the character is as he was in batman foreverand having your work on portraying any element of the batman universe compared to joel schumachers efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan also putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that filmhonestly collora is practically begging for it with such a similar initial reveal to be made and lets face it this loses in every respect michael antonik most definitely does not possess the screen presence that tommy lee jones does and the makeupwhich in aforementioned reveal is essential isnt as strong as that of the filmwhether or not it was good in the film is another matter the sad thing is that while fiorellajohn who created grayson seems to be far more into the comics and get them the depth of them betternot to mention possessing more of an ability to come up with compelling plot grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films or more collora seems to be the one with access to funds and the one whos more likely to have contactson account of having nonindie credits on his filmography to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer i intend to watch other of colloras work but fiorella is the one of the two whose work i will most definitely be most interested in i recommend this to fans of the characters 710
