this is a fanmade short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs batman and superman its the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like comiccon and was made by the same person who made batman dead end sandy collorabr br as far as this film goes i could easily pick it apart sure the cgi effects arent perfect and the costumes are far from perfect but this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible i was particularly impressed by the very buff supermanhe was no wimpy little guy if only this were a preview for a real filmtheyd have fans lined up from here to omaha to see it great job
