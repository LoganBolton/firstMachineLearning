i really liked batman dead end i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film this trailer didnt quite give me the same impression the story line or potential story line was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television showbr br first michael ohearn is not that good a superman i actually thought he in his brief appearance made a decent clark kent sorry i just dont think of superman as being that buff the suit kent wore masked his size batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman supes is toned no doubt but not bulk anyway i didnt care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy now this may not be just ohearns fault collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and directionbr br second the special effects for flying were cheezy superman flies through the sky if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him i dont think there were any full body shots of superman flying evidently the harness and rigging supporting ohearn must have been located on his lower torsobr br all in all it was a good trailer id probably pay to see a film if ever made and would be sure to catch it on television the story line an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries superman jealous of loiss attraction to wayne lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman  superman is a good one im sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company even ohearn could deliver a decent film certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately
