ill say this to begin withwhy oh why cant wb do what these short film directors do sandy is obviously an amazing director and deserves some credit from wb and dc but i guess theyre kinda put on edge when a man with a 12000 budget can make a superhero fan drool the worlds finest is one of the best short films ive ever seen trailer or notbr br i think choosing a bodybuildermike ohearn to play superman was a genius choice lets face it people superman is no supermodel he may be handsome but a gq stud he is not and i dont know what that guy a few comments above me was on but superman is actually pretty beefyhave you ever actually read a superman comic i guess that fact alone just floors meit seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual musclemass to play a superhero rather than a prettyface same thing for batman bartram is in incredible shape and an excellent batmani dont know guysif given a bigger budget and his own moviei think bale and bartram would be neck and neck bottom line this is one of only a scant few of superhero movies with actors that actually look the partbr br the acting is pretty nice as well i dont know what every one is talking about ohearn isnt that bad hes damn convincing as superman and bartramwell he is batman i mean come on people this movie had a 12000 dollar budget what were you expecting everyone else is great too except twoface seems a tad crazier than usualbut hey we only have tommylee jones as a reference oh lois is pretty hot toobr br the sfx are flippin sweet too i mean seeing superman lift the car upman how cool is that versus the tank scene in grayson i may have to put this one above that since mike actually looks like hes flying and with ease the flying sequences left something to be desired but once again with a bigger budgetoh and he even used a batmobileit was probably a model but it looked damned convincingbr br all in all this trailers only downfall was a lack of a serious budget and wb refuses to admit that collora is a credible director and needs to be apart of some kind a projectbut no theylllike most of the marvel projects just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about and keep churning out these gamble movies thank god superman returns was a hit or that seriously wouldve been the end of it worlds finest is excellent and in my book counts as a superhero movie
