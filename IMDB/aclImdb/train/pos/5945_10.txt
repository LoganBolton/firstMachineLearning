let me make one thing clearfor the most part the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly psses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved iconic characters from the pages of comic books why well lets take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall webr br executive no1 hey theres lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days br br executive no2 good point lets make one with haste then  well do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon the dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out br br executive no1 great now who can we get to play the part br br executive no2 whos a big box office star at the moment br br executive no1 name of big actor is the in thing this week br br executive no2 but does he really suit the role i mean he doesnt resemble the character whatsoever br br executive no1 who cares hes a big name well make the film with him in it anyway br br executive no2 youre quite right and besides well fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anywaybr br the above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally loath most modern superhero movies all style no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads of course to be equitable there are exceptions to the above rule when hollywood does get it right  take the casting of the original and still easily the best superman christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen in the xmen filmsbr br but back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood todaywouldnt it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles well in this less than ideal world one filmmaker does just this believe it or not by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts his name is sandy collora sadly but typically hollywood has not as of yet allowed collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two as of yet famous super hero short features one is the superb batmandead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called worlds finestbr br well lets not mince our words here  this is absolutely awesome stuffbr br the casting of mr universe winner and male model michael ohearn who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel in fact in terms of physical resemblance there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic characterbr br added to this clark bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batmandead end again yet another hugely judicious piece of castingbr br what can i say  if only this was indeed a real full length film hollywood studio executives  take note this is how it should be donebr br as a final note i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans tellingly the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more as similarly with batman dead end from a younger less cinematically experienced audience a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood will no doubt derive great satisfaction from after all these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of cgi addicted popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that hollywood churns out by the deluge these days
