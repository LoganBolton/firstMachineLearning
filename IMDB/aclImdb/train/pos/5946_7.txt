worlds finest is an unique project its a trailer for a supermanbatman crossover movie that doesnt exists and will also never exists at least not in this form with these characters actors and plot line anywaybr br so the movie is one big tease even more than standards everyday real movie trailers the trailer will hype you all up for nothing in that regard i really didnt liked this short project when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad and perhaps youll even feel cheated afterward when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place surely to show off sandy colloras skills but couldnt he had also done this with a real movie short like his earlier movie batman dead endbr br but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is so from a movie technical point of view its a really great one its great looking and way more professional than youll perhaps at first would expect although the people whove already seen batman dead end will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets cheap homemade costumes and thirdrate actors the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasnt skyhigh but for most part its very impressive and professional looking with nice costumes sets special effects cinematography and lightingbr br the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey it works well for the trailer style it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones mainly the superman flying sequences it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car with a camera aimed at him from an angle below i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for thisbr br michael ohearn seemed like a pretty good supermanclark kent although he obviously isnt the greatest talented actor around clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enoughbr br its especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie in the movies batman begins and superman returns its interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one its actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey the actor who played lex luthor in superman returnsbr br its a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more even though you know that there wont be more whatever happened to the waner bros plans to create an actual full length supermanbatman movie by the way i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made batman begins and superman returnsbr br 710
