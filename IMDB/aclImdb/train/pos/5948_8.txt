some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesnt pretend to be either youll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen werent exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs  but beautiful moonlight becomes you its always you the day after forever etc  to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine  and unfairly neglected  ballad once and for always plus a couple of upbeat philosophylite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing the flimsy plot isnt meant to be taken seriously  why else make merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friendmentor to arthur  so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully youre not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie on balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it
