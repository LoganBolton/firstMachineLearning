the title says it allbr br im not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this moviebr br obviously this movie didnt have a multimillion dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvdbr br ill definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films br br dylan oleary cast and crew i thank you
