unlike some comments mine is positive this movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends some you like some you dont a few are relatedmother daughter son their stories are not one smooth happy with everyone and everything type of lifemuch like real life some story lines do not evolve they just happen but like true families and good friends they stick together the wannabe parents who are buying a baby are such aholes you are happy for the ending poor delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself her mom her son and trying to keep all their lives together this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the burbs and all are living in a dream world but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day month to month overall this is a good story and a great movie
