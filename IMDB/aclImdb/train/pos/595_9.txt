when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction as long as that stands we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this centurybr br but i would say the alamo thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed ive seen john waynes film is a good one if overhyped but its a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he wasbr br its a lot closer to professor lon tinkles book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that tinkles book is listed as the source in both films but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the resultbr br alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that one thing that was not explored and hasnt been was traviss hyperactive sex drive he was the casanova of the southwest he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquestsbr br but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie played here by james arness he was a hero at the alamo to be sure but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel he was a smuggler a slave trader an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to but his heroic death certainly redeemed him no hint of that is in arnesss portrayal nor any others ive seen of bowie on the screen and of course he did design the bowie knife done to his specifications that man needed such a weaponbr br however the main asset that the alamo thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans whove come to settle in texas at mexican invitation unfortunately those americans came with some preconceived notions about liberty that just hadnt made it that far south at least liberty for white people raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history he was also quite the scoundrel but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came alongbr br this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston greenes not quite my conception of houston he really was way too old for the part houston was in his early forties in 1836 he was not yet the patriarch of texas but within the limits imposed on him greene does a fine jobbr br for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john waynes version but for historical content i recommend this film highly
