its great to see jorja fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot also loved hearing her sing nice change to see her out of her csiwest winger roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why each character was quirky though and in some cases i couldnt wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next this movie wasnt full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them
