ive seen a slew of 80s rocker horrors over the years from rubbish like terror on tour to ridiculously fun gems like slumber party massacre 2 somehow i managed to keep putting this one off which is strange because its probably the most popular and well received one well i finally caught up with it and its easily the best of this mostly awful but almost always endearing subgenre the plot which was pretty much lifted in the film black roses concerns a mulleted misfit named eddie whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music he loves 80s metal especially his idol sammi curr played by the late great tony fields after sammi is killed eddie favorite radio dj gives him sammis final recording once eddie plays the record backwards he discovers hes a bit tougher and bad things start happening to those who taunt him is sammis music possessed trick or treat is wellmade and a total hoot the special effects are awesome even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams i grew up in the 80s and while i wasnt a fan of heavy metal i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan worshipping haha i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and ozzy worshipped satan so its very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a antirock priest if only i had seen this film as a kid while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal the viewer never really finds out why sammi curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way this is movies weakest point but if you can overlook that its loads of fun
