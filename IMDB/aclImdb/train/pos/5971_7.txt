skippy from family ties goes from cleancut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves  except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave using skippy to help out and while the plot is corny and cliche the corniness for example an evil green fog taking off a girls clothesand the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious and great and of course theres nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher whos asking what happened to the love song  definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh and while youre at it make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2  theres an evil rocker as stated on the video boxdriller killer in black leather wfringe a must see for cheesy movie fans
