every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastwaybr br the movie itself was typical 80s guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyedbr br matt from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose the highlight being where tony sings lipsynchs and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fanbr br there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
