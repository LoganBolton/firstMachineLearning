trick or treat quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80s culture of heavy metal and horror moviestwo things which i love dearly so as you can imagine this movie appealed to me pretty easily plus for no apparent reason ozzy osbourne plays a preacherbr br this film is about an unpopular high school youth who like all us losers ended up drenched in a world of evil heavy metal his favorite metaldude dies and of course is miraculously resurrectedby playing his latest unreleased album backwards this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sht helping outbr br okay its pretty cheesy at times but you know what its got a surprising number of good qualities decent acting including gene simmons as a radio dj pretty good special effects very brief nudity decent atmosphere all in all its actually a decent horror film but what really sucks is the music ironic huh well this uberevil metal guy is one of the most obnoxious highpitched wailing motley crue rejects on the planetand the metal is little more than putrid 80s pophair metal he hits all the clich√©s here from prancing around like a gay fairy to looking mean to screaming rock and roll in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch aside from that atrocious musical representation its actually pretty good 710br br wwwresidenthazardcom
