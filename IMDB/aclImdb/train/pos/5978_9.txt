this is a true 80s movie back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays and that makes many of them quite interesting it was a cultural phenomenon that dont exist anymore nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap straighttovideomovies in the eighties are doing cheap porn porn seems to sell anyway this is above the medium trashmovie level it has goodfascinating story and its quite well made i think in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons but they dont very much contribute to the film success although they are good in their small roles the monsterheavysinger sammi curr looks really terrible especially when hes singing one of the scariest monsters ive seen in horror flicks i may have nightmares of him next night not recommended for intellectual movie lovers
