trick or treat is a fine example of hollywood jumping on the backwards messages in metal music bandwagon that tipper gore and her washington wives kickstarted in the mid80s other less successful entries in this minigenre include the awful black roses and silly the gate i was a sophomore in high school when trick or treat came out and couldnt wait to see it it seemed to disappear from video stores by the end of the 80s but i finally picked up a budgetpriced dvd copy a short while ago and it brought back many pleasant metal memories from back in the day any teenage metal nerd could relate to the trials of eddie ragman weinbauer marc price of family tiesin this film as he is persecuted by the preppie beautiful people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste eddies favorite rock star is sammi curr who looks a lot like tommy lee of motley crue who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie eddie is inconsolable till he receives a test pressing of sammis final unreleased album from a radio dj gene simmons of kiss in a brief cameo eddie soon discovers that this lp when played backwards allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of sammi curr himself soon sammi is giving eddie advice on how to get even with his preppie torturers but when the messages escalate in scariness wasteem all no false metal eddie tries to destroy the album which results in sammi coming back to life via eddies stereo speakers sammi rampages to the big dance at eddies high school and takes the stage to rock the crowd and disintegrate a few unlucky false metallers before eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams sigh no its not terribly scary in 2006 it wasnt even scary in 1986 but trick or treat is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metaller and has a kickass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band fastway well worth seeking out if youve ever banged your head or have a taste for bgrade horror movies or both like me
