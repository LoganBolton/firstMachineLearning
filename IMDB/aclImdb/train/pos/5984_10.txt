this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context  it was meant to be a parody of teenhorrordevilworship movies and the 80s saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of kiss it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with ozzy as a metalhating preacher cant be all bad also fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrackbr br the original vhs this was predvd cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was 90 i really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price the ozzygene cover was only created for the 5 rerelease the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put em on the cover same thing with the original little shop of horrors  jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main starbr br i have a trick or treat web site and its surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to sammi currbr br allinall it was just a good time rocknroll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed
