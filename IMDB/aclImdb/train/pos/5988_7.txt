this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael curtizs film angels with dirty faces as directed by ray enright the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with whats going on with the youth in americas inner cities todaybr br the film is only worth seeing because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan who showed they were well paired together the dead end kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folksbr br in a way its curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in new york it was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created in todays climate with so many guns around there is a new reality the young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals how times change
