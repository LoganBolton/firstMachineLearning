the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named gabe who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids the kids in this film are little punks but they are much less antisocial than theyd been in other previous films and down deep they are wellmeaning punks however in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoatafter all hed been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed so when gabe is about ready to be sent back to the big house its up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooksbr br the dead end kids appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good particularly angels with dirty faces however after the boys contracts expired they went on to monogram studios and the films to put it charitably were very weak and formulaicwith huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed the bowery boys because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera its a pretty good filmand almost earns a score of 7 its real close in fact while this isnt a great film aesthetically its sure a lot of fun to watch so i will give it a 7 sure it was a tad hokeyparticularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rightsbut it was also quite entertaining the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support sure this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charmingso if you can suspend disbelief it works well
