i dont have much to add to what has been said before but its very much a film of its time and the first and likely only time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kidsbr br the warners gave the boys plenty of help from director ray enright and an a budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors at every turn we get one of those gem performances from real pros they are too many to list but it seems like just about everybody on the warners lot sans the very biggest stars walk through this picture see if you can spot john ridgelybr br the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in gunga din hes something to watch and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since dead endbr br my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like city for conquestbr br hooray for warners
