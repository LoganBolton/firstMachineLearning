a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids as a matter of fact with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces at least for continuitys sakebr br speaking of ann sheridan she is the one true shining light of this movie to paraphrase a clich√© ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvdbr br another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan unfortunately  this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background for a better example of the sheridanreagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row
