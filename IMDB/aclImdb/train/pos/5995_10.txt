not sure if it was right or wrong but i read thru the other comments before watching the shorti have to say i disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with itbr br as a first time lone wolf directorproduceri like to see things that i can aspire tonot necessarily from the pros but by people just getting their feet wet like mebr br if indeed this is also from a firsttimeras i readi applaud the effortmarvelous job then in that respect there were some comments about the musici thought it was quite nice for the piecesome say it kind of droned along for a while but i found that created tension withoutusnecessarily being conscious of it and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chordsit was like we knew there was a train on the tracks but realize it is just now moving yes there is a 180 degree slipclip in there but shi happensdid anyone else see hughs dirty shirt turn white near the endin the rain in australia look how much money and people were behind that movie give the kid a break for gods sake all in all i think it was very well done only 2 things i would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioningdont walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera and i would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot so people wouldnt necessarily know what it isbr br my experience so far has taught me that its not that its hard to make a movieit just takes time to learn how to do itthen the time to actually do it and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details youll need to have shot before you call postproduction time imho it looks like directorwriter ryan jafri did his homework and if this indeed is his first report card id give him an a the rest of you report to the principals office for a whuppin
