this is an odd film for me as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker far out by phil mucci another writerdirector ryan jafri contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film the cure i dont normally review films this way but what the hecki love shorts and couldnt wait to see anotherbr br interestingly while it turned out i did like the cure i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know to his credit he encouraged me to review it anywaygiving it my honest appraisalbr br the film has tremendous style and as far as jafris direction goes its exceptionalespecially for such an inexperienced film maker its his first film the combination of exceptional choices of color pacing and music that wellsuited the film created a great sense of atmosphere you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making however the thing i didnt love was some of the writing while the basic idea was great the ending was just too easy to foresee i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist however considering that this film is from someone who shouldnt be able to make such a professional film given his experience it bodes well for his future good job
