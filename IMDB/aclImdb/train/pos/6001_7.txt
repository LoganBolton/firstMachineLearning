by no means a masterpiece and far from errol flynns best istanbul still has much going for it the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography bring us back to a time long since past errol flynn does show moments of his past glory and is ok as jim brennan a pilot whos past comes back to haunt him the picture is actually a remake of 1947s singapore and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche by todays standards also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply going through the motions in this picture many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats casablanca while watching the film i could see many of the similarities but hey casablanca has inspired countless imitators so take that for what its worth in closing if you are a fan of flynn or old fashioned love stories you might want to give this film a look otherwise id recommend casablanca or the maltese falcon as a good introduction to some of hollywoods classics
