zabriskie point 1970 this was especially interesting to me on a personal level since it takes place under identical circumstances with identical peers in my own life Â– the counter culture movement of the late 60searly 70s on and off campus we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories who are slowly woven together one is a young man in los angeles tired of all the endless pseudorevolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus and the other a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father  employer and take on an establishment job the film is full of our italian directors michelangelo antonioni visual notations of america and the confused psychedelicrazies of that eras selfrighteous we know it all well change everything for the better youth just who is the revolutionary what does that really mean do you dress like one and march around chanting do you fly in under the radar but give advance notice of your arrival do you keep your plans to yourself and go about the business of change with no need for group approval zabriskie point is definitely a period piece  full of slang uniforms somewhat surreal film moments after all this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing blow up of 1966 and the eras artifacts but it is more it presents options for cultural revolution and going by antonioni who does seem to be supportive of it the youth are too selfinvolved to see what is needed for radical success because of this it becomes a powerful frightening film that applies to anyone any time any place
