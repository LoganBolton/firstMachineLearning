all of the reviews here about how much zp lacks plot the acting is wooden the orgy scene makes no sense etc all miss the main pointbr br lets be honest this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles it is a movie meant to be watched while your are high out of your mind on some psychedelic substancebr br find some kind bud and smoke up or get a mild hit of acid seriously these straight and sober reviews of zp miss the point you cant get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mindbr br until youve watched this movie on the big screen which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when zp was quite rare tripping out you have no idea what this movie is all aboutbr br if you insist on watching it not intoxicated you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyds wonderful reworking of careful with that axe eugene come in number 51 your time is up
