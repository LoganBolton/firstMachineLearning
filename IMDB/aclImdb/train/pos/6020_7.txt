a beautiful new print of zabriskie point is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter its time for a full evaluation of the film lets hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful extras will be out in the near futurebr br i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a nearmiss masterpiece the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late 60s los angeles i lived there then and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding workbr br the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes it is forbidden to those under 16 or 18 i cant remember i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print spoiler  i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut what appears today seems rather tame by current standardsbr br there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts etc antonioni was very daring to do this i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of nonactors mark frechette and daria halprin this time frechette did not bother me halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continuesbr br much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me one shot is in a different aspect ratio  distorted by the wide screen of course there is actual staged footage but not all that muchbr br im still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane it looks like he really did some of the flying  theres no blue screen or double in some shotsbr br i hope to get back to see the film a second time recommended highly to all antonioni fans
