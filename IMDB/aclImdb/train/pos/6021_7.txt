though this may not necessarily be a socalled classic film by todays standards its still worth seeing the main reason why is because after experiencing this film you get the feeling that youve also experienced the countercultural idealism of the 60s no matter however good or badbr br i happened to see this film in an english literature class at suny geneseo and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60s icons the film is far from being simply thrown togetherbr br my point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused the film has done its job its conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry it was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplifiedbr br as such zabriskie point may not tell a very good or interesting story and at the same time its characters may be onesided and predictable however it also conveys so well this sort of clich√©d rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both mark and daria must share even the antiestablishment students are as inauthentic as the govt they rebel against
