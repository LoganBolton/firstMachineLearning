i saw zp when it was first released and found it a major disappointment its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey 60s its politics too upfront and ridiculous and lets face it i was still under a lovespell known as blowup  and i still havent completely shaken it now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well    good luck to mebr br but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been a teacher to me i revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age and zp is its own experienceand is only really linked to blowup through its creator the lategreat mr antonionibr br twelve years ago i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size immense restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared it was like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of placebr br what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its ownbr br i remember the second time around seeing it  the early 80s  i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular whereas before these two seemed like a smartalecky shadow version of zefferellis olivia and leonard read romeo and julietthey now were engaging me  particularly the girl in her insistent slomotionality shetookhertime    to live everything everything dies around herbr br upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found enjoyment the encroaching shoulderpadded big haired 80s whispered but thats a hippie fantasy  let it gobr br the force of antonionis vision had i had realised already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered 80s with an uhhuh and guarded my love secretly possessively and jealouslybr br but this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back secretly jealously and possessively and you get changedbr br was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup undoubtedly zp must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment but hey sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at allbr br today reality hit zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alices restaurantbr br so it is still too difficult too disturbing too whatbr br maybe its that as with all good art it lives while everything dies around it br br peace
