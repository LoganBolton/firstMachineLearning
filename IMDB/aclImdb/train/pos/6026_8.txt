this film has a powerful philosophical ending but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginningbr br youth alienation in the late 1960s from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman is the obvious theme of zabriskie point neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience a fact that actually enhances the films message having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around thembr br this is not a scriptdriven film except for the first ten minutes it is mostly visual with stunning cinematography the beautiful naturalistic images seem otherworldly and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and dariabr br i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors many scenes cry out for riders on the stormbr br even so i like this film its different its unique it is artistic and imaginative and the desert badlands are beautifulbr br as the years go by zabriskie point seems more and more attractive it conveys the mood of the late 1960s in america it is amazingly artistic in a bohemian sort of way and the films last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing
