i was told it was one of those either you love it or you hate it movies well i loved it obvious hippieera dated and easy symbolism and all so i probably have no taste at all when it comes to antonioni but this and la notte made exactly a decade earlier are my favourites among his movies so far made two years before i was born zabriskie point was supposed to have been michelangelos great american epic but apparently it turned out to be a flop i really cant see why before watching it id read that it was rather boring so i braced myself for a very slow movie  though i love me a slow movie for my taste zabriskie didnt have a tedious minute in it while watching it i made a mental note of how european it was on the directors part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight this recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in american society but then i watched leclisse straight afterwards which is set in rome in the early 60s and noticed that antonioni often included billboards in it as well after all the masterful use of landscapes architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an antonioni trademark  this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters psychological states with more or less understated power and great visual impact he is virtually unsurpassed in this skillbr br zabriskie point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s but never did mark frechette whom id already seen in francesco rosis fine wwiset movie uomini contro had a very tragic life and died aged just 27 according to his biography page he donated his 60000 earnings from zabriskie to a commune marks costar daria halprin apparently also dennis hoppers wife later on has the stunning natural beauty and appeal of a young ornella muti  one of those luminous beauties that dont need a shred of makeup to turn heads like frechette she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star but at least she didnt die tragically most notably zabriskie point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed  one that brings home a sense of youthful playfulness like few ive seen  as well as a powerfully cathartic ending it may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes but i cant see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release never has an explosion looked so good and so poetic it seems to be an explosion that restores order rather than bringing chaos
