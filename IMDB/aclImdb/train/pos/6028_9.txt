this is the film in antonionis middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a flawed look at 60s american youth culturepolitics for what its worth i found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like lavventura perhaps because he shows more emotion  empathy here than anywhere else the story is simple but it is used as a frame for antonionis brilliant observations of and critique on american consumerist culture student life the counterculture and the whole antiestablishment antiwar backlash that was so prominent then br br even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert lovein to the use of billboards and right down to that jawdropping cathartic finale that used 17 camera setups in its own way as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch also antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria halperin one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen there isnt much acting involved as this feels more like a docudrama and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context and the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music its use is impressive as well i cant forget the start of the film mostly due to the selection of music  by pink floyd  that grooms the visuals so wellbr br contrary to popular opinion this is quite an achievement in cinema and one i would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat well worth seeking out and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a dvd restorationrelease
