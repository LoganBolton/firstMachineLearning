there arent too many times when i see a film and go huh what but this was one of them maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing 2001 he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on michelangelo antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us after red desert he did blowup this film china and the passenger all filmed outside his native italy i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium the results show that he doesnt lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era a directors job is to see antonioni once stated whatever that means he doesnt disappoint for the admirer of his postfifties work i say postfifties since ive yet to see any of his films from before lavventurabr br what he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in blowup and the eclipse you get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors dont bring much conviction or purpose antonioni coming from the school of hardknocks neorealistic filmmaking does do what he can with his mostly nonprofessional cast those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars mark frechette and daria halprin seem as if antonionis underdirecting them perhaps that was the point the storys split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60s la area and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting they meet by chance as marks plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there and darias car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isnt terribly interesting br br the two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity the ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay cowritten by sam shepard arent too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs reality is brought up then the film heads towards the third act as mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and daria arrives at her boss place only to be in full disillusionment not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film although the film took its time telling its story i didnt have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the selfconfidence of the antiestablishment but maybe antonioni isnt entirely fully aware of it himself in some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by alfio contini find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isnt involving to a degree this may make some feel drowsy as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is br br the deserts skies city and even the faces in closeups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in the soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal pink floyd song retitled from careful with that axe eugene one of their best predark side in the explosion sequence if only the performances werent so onesided i might find this to be on par with blowup or the eclipse its an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippieradical movement of the late 60s but hey what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us such as say italy and it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing
