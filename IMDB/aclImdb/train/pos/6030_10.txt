i know that this is an unpopular position concerning zabriskie point but i loved this film i know i know  i can legitimately be called an antonioni fanatic i love lavventura i love la notte i love leclisse i love red desert i love blowup and i love professione reporter aka the passenger the only antonioni film that i dont love the only one ive ever given less than an 810 and one of only three that i have given less than a 1010 la notte and leclisse being the other two though i fully acknowledge that i have to see both of them again is beyond the clouds which can fairly be called an awful film however there is not better awful film if you catch my drift so if youre not an antonioni fan you should only logically ignore me if you are even a casual fan though and you are wondering whether this particular film whose name when spoken is often followed bybr br a spit which is generally despised by even antonionis admirers is at all worth seeing the answer is yesbr br okay the reason that people tend to hate it is because 99 of film watchers care only for the narrative of a film well thats not exactly true if a film is amazing in a particular aspect say acting or cinematography or direction and just decent in its narrative film watchers might very well love it but a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece and have a lame or illogical story  thats another thing that has ruined the cinema over the years logic  then they absolutely hate the film i will actually agree with that in some ways as much as i may dislike it and want to change my view it really is difficult to love a film whose narrative i perceive as poor however other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative this is certainly what must drive viewers away from zabriskie point i could relate the story to you but you probably would just think it was nonsensical it is actually but to me that just made the whole endeavor more fantastic and beautiful id actually compare it favorably to 2001 which is my favorite film however 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this filmbr br what zabriskie point has in spades is mood the music helps a lot the score includes a lot of acts of the day including pink floyd the mood is kind of similar to the moods of antonionis other masterpieces filled with loneliness and desolation also the freedom that comes from that the best sequence in the film is when the lead man and woman her name is daria i know but i dont remember his name pull over in their vehicle next to a historic marker on a desert highway there is beyond the stone wall that has been erected to keep cars from flying off an ancient lakebed its basically a rocky desert and the two go to play in it the setting is enormously beautiful the woman says this is such a beautiful place what do you think the man i think its dead theres no inclination to whether thats a good thing or a bad thing this is a lot like sentiments expressed in other antonioni films  characters are constantly wanting to disappear or become invisible instead of david locke the protagonist of the passenger fed up with journalism we have the young hippie sick of his friends politics  he thinks they talk too much and dont act out what they feel is right or at least he says he does it seems to me more like he just wanted out of the situationbr br the film is also simply amazing visually antonionis films are all identifiable by just a few frames but his visual style was always building i like the passenger more than i do zabriskie point but zabriskie point might be his ultimate accomplishment in that aspect well that might sound odd  lavventura and red desert are amazing pictorially i think its the camera movements that are particularly amazing here he obviously made a ton of money on blowup which was the biggest arthouse hit of its day the biggest ever at that point he spends it well here especially with his aerial shots one of the films greatest sequences involves the man who has stolen a mans private airplane divebombing daria in her carbr br the one thing that can be fairly criticized is the films politics theyre certainly facile not that hippies were facile but that antonionis vision of hippies  there werent any in italy of course  are bizarre and well filtered through a foreigners eyes theres a rather childish criticism of advertising but its a criticism that still exists today i say cant you people just ignore it what does it hurt are you walking around buying things you dont want because of billboards or there is also the criticism against capitalism daria a secretary works for a company that is stealing the land in the desert  the land that she and the man enjoyed to themselves  in order to make cheap suburban homes for families rod taylor a very underrated actor whose most famous roles were in the time machine and the birds plays her boss the ending which i wont ruin  youve got to see it  is almost offensively cheap i can though understand the treatment of police officers not that i disdain them generally but they were awful at the time they can still be awful now theyve always had too much powerbr br these trite arguments against the american way of life still dont effect my opinion of the film much i find this filtered view of america extremely interesting i really dont think a hippie would have disagreed with antonioni 1010
