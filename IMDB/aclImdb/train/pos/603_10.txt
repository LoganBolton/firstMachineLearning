the music of albeniz pervades this film once and a while it is played with original instrumentation eg piano but never full orchestra but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles egguitar and treatments eg jazz piano only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always i would guess that there are 12Â–14 scenes which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine those that worked for me moved me to gooseflesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture if you dont like subtitles dont worry the film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here european dvds wont play on american dvd players this is a scandal
