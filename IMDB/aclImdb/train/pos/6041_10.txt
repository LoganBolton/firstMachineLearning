this is one to watch a few times the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth the title was a great choice great film setting story soundtrack and characters its a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way funny to the bone kinda like trailer park boys in the uk if youve never seen tpb make a point to if you like this film you will thank me i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done theres a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes
