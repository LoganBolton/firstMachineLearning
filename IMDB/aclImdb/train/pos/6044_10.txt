a great british indy movie fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drugfuelled set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of great to see phil daniels back on the big screen even if he has swapped sides since quadrophenia and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies loved the final fight scene with its nod to zulu and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the popshes not actinghe really is a bonafide british hippie you dont have to be a biker to enjoy this and its straight into my friday night postpub repeat viewing collection br br give this film a go and you wont be disappointed
