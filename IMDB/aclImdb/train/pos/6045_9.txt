i was in the film too but i dont know if they actually put this scene in on the way back from a school trip in 2005 we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film and we were asked the whole of us to run in and shout go freebird we were all around 10 years old could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film it would be great to know i remember i thought the film had never come out because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released all of your comments seem to be good so im guessing it has been quite a successful film i might buy it but first i would like to know if im in it d thank you
