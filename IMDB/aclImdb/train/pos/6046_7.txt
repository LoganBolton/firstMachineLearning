i was pleasantly surprised by the film lets face it the premise doesnt sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the nights flick but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over there were no moments that i found uproarious and i doubt any that ill remember the next day but this doesnt fail as a nice diversion what i found funny was watching it here in peking with my chinese girlfriend who never understands anything i like i told her there was a plot three guys have to bring back some weed to london hardly satisfying for her there is no mugging going on here for the camera which id been expecting after reading a number of the comments i do take exception however to comparisons with withnail and i not in the same league and i doubt was it intended to wwwimperialflagsblogspotcom
