what a class bit of british cinema its about time and a side splitting comedy to bootbr br anyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the ticketbr br its a mix between withnail and i and easy rider the movie runs at a solid pace and doesnt let you drift off for too long at times there are reflective moments but i think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying i was a little concerned with phil daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie generally i found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me oh wellbr br i would thoroughly recommend it this will become a cult british comedy well worth a visit
