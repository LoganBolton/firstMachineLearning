freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy gang caper stoner film and feelgood british moviebr br it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre stars phil daniels gary stretch and geoff bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic the main story centres around their road trip from london to wales and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way this small film also has a great heart  it is not just for bike fans as it bases around the characters relationships with each other including dreams and regrets such as gary stretchs fred longing for the family he left behind the cinematography is also great  a love letter to the welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of london streets and typical pub life in the welsh country townsbr br stylish slick fantastic soundtrack likable characters and funny storyline  i would recommend freebird in a heartbeat
