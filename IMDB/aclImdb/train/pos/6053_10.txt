a comedy gem lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing uncontrollably the characters are recognisable and the dialogue wellobserved  i know people like this the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an ealing comedy its a quirky little film with lots of detail it certainly takes a number of viewings ive watched it a few times ive been showing all my friends and notice something new each time  a bit of dialoguesomething visual that i hadnt picked up on before i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but im not going to because overall this is a great fun feelgood film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy it is a film which will find its friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack
