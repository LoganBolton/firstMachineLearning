this movie is horrible in a so bad its good kind of waybr br the storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind that im not going to even bother describing it its a swordsorcery picture has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world has a nomadic adventurer an evil aidesorcerer a princess a hairy creatureyou get the pointbr br the first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter i dont know why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel but when i caught site of gulfax i decided to stay and watch it until the endbr br gulfax is a white furry creature akin to chewbacca but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within or that hes almost falling over although he isnt in the movie that much the few scenes are worth it watch as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson taking the solochewbacca comparisons to an even higher level br br i actually bought this movie just because of that character and still have it somewhere br br gulfax may look like sht but he made this movie the only reason ive never seen the sequel or even sought it out was because of his absence perhaps should there be a final film completing the trilogy gulfax will make a muchanticipated return
