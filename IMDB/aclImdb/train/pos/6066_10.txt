when i saw this movie first it was long ago on vhsvideo i did like this movie because it was funny and excitingly some years ago i saw another movie called andy colbys incredible adventure in this movie were parts of wizards of the lost kingdom used in they called this movie kor the conquerer i began to search for the kormovie many years because i wanted to see the complete movie not only the parts which were used in the andy colbymovie no shop had this kormovie to rent and no shop did know this movie many years i watched my old vhstapes i had at home and what a wonder i had this movie since many years still at home but the movie had a different title because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching kor the conquerer again the music is great during the hole movie but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest the music in the background had some kind of magic i like bo svenson and also the boy who played simon in the movie both of them did their job very good manfred kraatz germany 26102004 thanks to all for reading my comment
