although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie i am ashamed to say i rather like it not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham video so it is most definitely worth a viewing Â£079 a night in my local store watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monsters costume the fact that the hero looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following evil wizardtype bloke at last we meet kor kor thrilling isnt itbr br amazingi also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falconlike bird carrying a handsome hero to safety among other such interesting and engaging suggestions of what goes on in the actual film none of them actually happen no im not jokingthere really isnt a raging sea or a ferocious bird its just trying to make you interestedclassic in my opinion this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value
