branagh and fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the shakespeare classic branagh plays iago better than ive seen the character played in film or on stage some might say this film is overly iagocentric but i disagree fishburne the first black othello in film history ironically delivers a powerful performance fishburne has always been a good actor but this performance as the moor of venice may be one of his best br br the one problem i have with this film is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes desdemonas character is given far less depth than she has in the play in this film she might as well not be added at all one of the worst cuts made by branagh in this film was the subtraction of a conversation between iago and desdemona at the beginning of the second act this part of the play shows that desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film there were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film br br however if you have not read the play or seen a film version of othello before i recommend this movie the story cut or not is still incredibly enthralling the acting as stated previously is very good if some important scenes had been added and desdemonas character been prioritized a bit further this would be a great movie as it stands its still an admirable version of the original i give it a marginal recommendation
