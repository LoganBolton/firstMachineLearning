my college professor says that othello may be shakespeares finest drama i dont know if i agree with him yet i bought this video version of the film first i love kenneth branagh as iago he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation surprisingly he didnt direct it but played a role lawrence fishburne shows that american actors can play shakespeare just as well as british actors can do not that there was a british vs american issue about it in fact if we all work together then shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do apart from other shakespeare tragedies this is dealt with the issue of race something that has existed since the beginning of time the relationship between iago and emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together while othello loves desdemona with all his heart he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a nonmoorish man like cassio its quite a great scene at the end of the film but i wont reveal the ending its just worth watching i think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit shakespeare
