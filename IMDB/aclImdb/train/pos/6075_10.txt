students often ask me why i choose this version of othello shakespeares text is strongly truncated and the film contains material which earned it an r ratingbr br i have several reasons for using this production first i had not seen a depiction of the moor that actually made me sympathetic to othello until i saw fishburne play him i saw james earl jones and christopher plummer play othello and iago on broadway and it was wonderful plummers energy was especially noticeable but in spite of jones incredible presence both physically and vocally the character he played just seemed too passive to illicit from me a complete emotional purgation in the aristotelian sense jones in fact affirmed what i felt when in an interview he noted that he had played othello as passiveseeing iago as basically doing him over unfortunately this sapped my grief for the character destruction thus i felt sympathy for jones moor but not the horror over his corruption by an evil man in contrast fishburnes othello is a strong and vigorous figure familiar with taking action thus iagos temptation to actively deal with what is presented to othello as his wifes unfaithfulness is a perversion of the generals positive quality to be active not passive1 the horror of the story is that this good quality in othello becomes perverted fishburnes depiction is therefore classically tragicbr br second fishburne is the first black actor to play othello in a film both orsen wells and anthony hopkins did fine film versions but they were white men in black face2 why is this important why should a black actor be the black man on the stage3 certainly in shakespeares day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls perhaps then the reason is the same female actors bring a special quality to female roles on the shakespearian stage because they understand best what shakespeares genius was trying to present a gifted black actor should play the moor because his experience in a white dominated culture is vital to understanding what shakespeares genius recognized the pain of being marginalized because of race an important theme in othello is isolation caused by racism although it is a mistake to insert american racism into a shakespearian play there can be little doubt that racism is still working among the characters many including desdimonas father think that a union between a venetian white christian woman and a north african black christian man is unnaturalbr br third shakespeare was never g rated he never has been his stage productions were always typified by violence and strong language but shakespeares genius uses these elements not as sensationialism but for artistic honesty
