i dont pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello but ive never witnessed a performance of the play on film or on stage wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticitybr br according to the biographical notes fishburne never received any professional training as an actor perhaps this explains why his acting in this beautifully edited film comes over as so believable and so powerful instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such highpowered roles fishburnes portrayal is focused more on othellos love for his wife and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal than on violence and vengeance in a word the performance is understated and made far more impressive by fishburnes extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have beenbr br the acting throughout is superb and the abridged speeches gain grace from their light editing even shakesspeare after all can be improved upon now and again  and if that be treason make the most of it
