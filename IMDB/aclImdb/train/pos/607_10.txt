maybe i loved this movie so much in part because ive been feeling down in the dumps and its such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than ive been for a whilebr br it is a very funny and clever movie the running joke of the kingdoms history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled thats much of what makes it so good its an elaborate specialeffectsladen movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small thingsbr br i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
