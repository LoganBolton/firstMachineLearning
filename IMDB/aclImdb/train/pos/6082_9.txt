ive always enjoyed kenneth branaghs versions of the shakespeare classics as he always does a very good job but in this movie the one who lifts the whole movie is none other than thealwaysgreatactor laurence fishburne surely he has made some poor choices in films even though hes a wonderful actor but in this one were truly given the real othello the passion the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with fishburnes well portrayed paranoia and furthermore were finally given a black othellobr br i dont think they could have chosen a better othello who else could have given him that blend of sympathyantipathy lovehatred and not to forget those fiery eyes branagh is good as always but not at his peak ir√©ne jacobs desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie do watch it
