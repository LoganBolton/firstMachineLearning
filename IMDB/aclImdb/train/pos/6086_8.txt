i saw this movie about a year ago and found it to be completely laughoutloud funny a real winner in my mind it had the underlining of a stupid comedy but indeed had an actual plot as well much like the hit comedy elf in fact it had a few serious moments sandwiched between hilarity when stiller shot blacks horse an ordinarily sober moment you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics you can actually find common ground there as im sure many people have done something they wouldnt want a friend to find out about lest your friendship should endbr br when i found out how much people disliked this movie i was completely dumbfounded that absolutely terrible movies like napoleon dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on imdb take my advice and rent it if you dont find yourself laughing at least once ill compensate you the rental fee d
