i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out i dont remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isnt for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben stillers jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didnt have anything good to say about it and it didnt get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isnt a movie for you im just giving you another persons opinion
