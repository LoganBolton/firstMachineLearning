like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban underachieversbr br this film was a dark comedy gem and im not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the jmans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens jman  all great stuffbr br i cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gembr br remember this people most times popular doesnt equal good
