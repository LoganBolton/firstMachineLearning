i just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all i can say iswhat did i just watch and i mean that in a good and bad waybr br the plot is really simple stiller and black play friendsneighbors stiller is the focused hardworker while black is a dreamer black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo the idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich the extravagant lifestyle that black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with stiller causes stiller to become crazy with envybr br as i said the plot is simple everything else is plain odd the direction is odd with a weird rotating opening shot to outofnowhere sped up sequences the dialouge and the acting is very odd odd in a rambling sort of way and the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie from the weird envy song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think youre going to hear a classic 80s song but suddenly its in japanesebr br so the true question is thisis odd funny that depends purely on the individual i was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie after the screening i heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free strangely i understood their point there are no jokes whatsoever so if you arent hooked by the uniqueness of it all you will hate this movie absolutely hate itbr br this movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a dvd cult classic if you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes like cable guy or punch drunk love then i suggest you see it if you dont run away from this movie itll only make you mad
