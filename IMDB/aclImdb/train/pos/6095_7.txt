im a bit conflicted over this the show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill moseley in one episode the dialogue is moronic and the premisemoral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short theres no way youll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and robert englunds cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a bob saget on americas funniest home videos kind of waybr br on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television the 80s fashions the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times the premises lend the material more to selfparody than scares so were left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his sats his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him another is afraid shell be locked up in prison because shes a substandard mom her husband is played by brad pit another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home another is afraid shell be confused with her sociallyretarded twin another is afraid if he doesnt break up his mom and stepdad hell get killed for having a party at his house the list goes on and onbr br being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices but theyre so out of left field that theres no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience you have characters dressed like something out of a 80sthemed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about itbr br if youre looking for something thatll scare you stay away if youre looking on the other hand for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever watch itbr br its been showing on chiller tv lately pretty much every day and ive been watching earlier out of morbid curiosity and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now
