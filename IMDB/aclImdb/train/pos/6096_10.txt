i know technically this isnt the greatest tv show everi mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of itthe acting can at time be also a little crumbybuti love this show so muchit scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988of course it would i was 5 years oldbut i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodeswhich unfortunately i hear is now deletedand i also heard warners arent going to release any more due to the first dvds bad salesalso the tv show didnt have the same feel as the moviesin fact i thought it had a more sinister toneeven though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4both that film and the tv show were made the same yearthis has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokeynot a bad thingi like freddy as the clown wise crackerbut i think that was the strenght of this tv showyou didnt have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebodyin fact this has more of a dream feel to itreinforced by the soft focus of the lenseim not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video i love this showand taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyablemuch better than anything on tv today
