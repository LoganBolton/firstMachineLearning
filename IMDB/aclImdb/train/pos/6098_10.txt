this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies poltergeist the legacy im not so sure it may have been loosely connected to the movies it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch itbr br it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parentsin the 1st episode i believe and the amount of parents were disappointing with all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies youd expect there to be more parents but oh wellbr br freddy is basically the narrator for the show he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt theres a supernatural or surprise ending twist involvedbr br the acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone 4 more movies came after the series  so it wasnt a total loss
