all kira reed fans must see this the films premise has struggling romance novelist kira unable to come up with any new ideas shes also getting over a divorce however she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell and clothing they go into a corner room and they do it thankfully kira gets a condom out now dont ever tell me these playboy films are worthless piles of softcore fluff remember kids safe sex later she marvels to her publishist how great it was but she didnt get his name despite this the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games but eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more when she does all hell breaks loose and ill leave it at that this is easily the best of these softcore playboys films ive seen check this out and marvel at the greatness of kira
