my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl theres no kissingsex scenes hollywood should learn more from korean productions sex is not always required in a good romantic moviebr br the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie i like the part when jihoon almost kissed suwan the funniest moment is when jihoon punched suwans first love because he dumped suwan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon how he became a father was revealed in the next scene which brings smiles to the audiencebr br mao points 810
