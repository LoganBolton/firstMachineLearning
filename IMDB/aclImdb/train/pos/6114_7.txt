a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001hit my sassy girl but is able to enchant most of the time the biggest applause should go to the two leads haneul kim is both sweet and quirky sangwoo kwon is both attractive and rebellious the chemistry between the two is very goodbr br director kyeonghyeong kim uses some cginserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sangwoo kwon can shine i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated volcano high and that boy has a future  those looks those fight techniques and a romantic lead not badbr br well i can make it short nice film my rating 710
