all i can say about the necromaniacschizophreniac 2 series is if you are even remotely pc or dont have a seriously messed up sense of humor then you probably wont get it as sick and disgusting as this movie is it really is a comedy and not a horror movie at all if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable to the point where is becomes so out of hand that its comical then you must see this to believe it this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldnt touch this with a 10 foot pole with a condom on the end in my opinion though the best most extreme pieces of art come from way underground if you dont stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing then they reject itbr br i have seen stacks of terrible boring zgrade indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvdr i have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars when a no budget film like these two from ron atkinsjohn giancaspro come out and blow all of the other shock films completely out of the water you really have to take a second look at the whole indy movie scene after seeing this you can really see how much freedom an indy film maker can have when they work on their ownbr br the funny thing is even the other people who saw this movie and hated it admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it i dont think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two so if dont take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously and are able to laugh at a misanthropic puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped you have to see this you may just be able to see it for the stand alone cult classic that it is both schizophreniac  schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds
