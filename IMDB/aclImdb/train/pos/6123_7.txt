before i comment about this movie you should realize that when i saw this movie i expected the typical crap horror bmovie and just wanted to have fun jack frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that ive seen in a long time scott mcdonald is great as jack frost in fact i think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance mcdonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements as soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people though you will find it hard not to laugh the lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny the fact that the rest of the cast completely overacts just adds to stupidity of the film but its stupidity is its genius the scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in bmovie horror film fashion i truly hope there is a sequel and ill be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it of course its only fun to watch the first few times and its not exactly a good work of motion picture technology but i just like to see snowmen kill people i gave it a 7 out of 10 this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours
