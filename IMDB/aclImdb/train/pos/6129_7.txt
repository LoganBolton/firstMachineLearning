note that i did not say that it is betterjust more enjoyable the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things movingbr br i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie as it has all the troma trademarks including spewing acidic liquids wisecracks from the villain after every murder a ridiculous bathtub rape scene which is sort of hard to get upset about since the rapist is a snowman and dumb deputiesbr br theres a lot to love br br 1 a snowman about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet drives a police cruiser around townbr br 2 even though it is supposed to be close to or below freezing nobodys breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are runningbr br 3 the snow reminds you more of flocking or styrofoam peanuts than actual snowbr br 4 a teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered she talks him into breaking into the sheriffs house of all places in order to get it on but first she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some winebr br 5 after teenaged jakes head is cut off by a sled runner his father argues with the sheriff about whether tommy the sheriffs son had anything to do with it the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldnt have been fighting with jake because jake is at least two feet taller than tommy at that moment someone in the background chimes in not anymore br br 6 when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions if i were an actor i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this pointbr br all in all a fun film theres not really even that much blood
