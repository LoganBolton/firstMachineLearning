this remarkable film can be summed up very easily first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable its almost futile to do so while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop stardust is so much different than any other fantasyscifi film ive ever seen its such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique thatalong with the performances special effects cinematography and scorethe finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist thirdly i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board this fantasy adventure with scifi elements was the best one ive seen since return of the king not that i am comparing the two at all ok so its not that easy to sum up but dont let any crude andor heartless and cynical review nor the films pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer or even possibly in a long time
