im glad that users as of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward i dont understand the people who didnt like this movie  it seems like they were expecting a serious  treatment cmon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didnt try to deny it the straightfaced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny yes there are times where the low budget shows such as that explosion scene but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie so if you like bmovies and the goofy premise appeals to you then youll certainly like jack frost
