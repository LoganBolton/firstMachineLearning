i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid so i didnt recall much of it as i watched it recently i sat there thinking this is the weirdest thing ive seenbr br the traveling scenes look like something caused by an lsd overdose the animated characters are mostly oddly coloredvoiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters some notsodisney things i noticed kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutesduring the portobello road songbr br it was very entertaining though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them also the subject manner was a bit dark seeing as it was set during ww2
