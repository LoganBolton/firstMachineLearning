fabulous fantastic probably disneys best musical adventure i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative clever and fun even despite the silly flying bed scenes the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppinsbr br david tomlinson though he had few quality movie roles absolutely shines in this adventure he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays blustering prim and proper englishman  nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justicebr br the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just dont capture i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantines house and she must defend it in any way she canbr br bobbing along bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers all of them are fantastic and worth remembering portobello road being one of my favoritesbr br a great film that still holds up today
