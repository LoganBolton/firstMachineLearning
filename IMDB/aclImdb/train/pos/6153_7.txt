the obvious parallels between walt disneys charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and cs lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney filmsbr br like the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country and those kids have to deal with a world of magic but unlike cs lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kidsbr br no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe its not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson ms lansbury didnt get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldnt top and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this filmbr br two performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks tessie oshea played her last role in this film she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the worldbr br the team of robert b sherman and richard m sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar but lost to the theme from shaft personally though i do like david tomlinsons tribute to that most colorful of london streets portabello roadbr br bedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics
