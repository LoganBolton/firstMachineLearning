bedknobs and broomsticks is a magical adventure film with a certain charm despite not being one of the best disney works it has a generally good story nice songs great characters good actors magical and delightful special effects good settings and lovely landscapes of englandbr br it also combines very well liveaction and animation the animation itself is of course pretty good the animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film robin hood and the same can be said about the animated characters there are plenty of wild animals such as bears elephants hippos lions crocodiles and others like in robin hood besides the king a lion seems to be a mix of prince john and king richard not to mention that the bear does look like little johnbr br this movie is often compared to mary poppins with a reason both combine liveaction and animation with a similar artwork both have similar settings in london both have their own magic and a magical woman the kids carrie charlie and cute little paul are a bit like the banks children both movies were directed by robert stevenson and both cast david tomlinson however instead of a very serious man like george banks david tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man  professor emelius browne with its magic this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to harry potters storiesbr br the majority of the songs are good the age of not believing and the beautiful briny sea are the very best portobello road is nice toobr br david tomlinson is great in this film once again angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too cindy ocallaghan as carrie ian weighill as charlie a boy in «the age of not believing» and roy snart as the youngest brother paulbr br i like the black cat its pretty cool it looks a bit like salem the black cat from the tv series sabrina the teenage witch i find cute whenever one of the movies characters is transformed into a white rabbit rabbits are really cute fluffy and adorable animals i just love them even funnier is whenever professor emelius browne is transformed into a white rabbit because when hes transformed in human again he shakes his nose like a rabbit its really hilarious combined with his comical figure and that mustachebr br overall this is an okay movie but its ending is quite bad the first minutes of the movie are nothing special but then it improves a lot the ending however is weak thats my major criticism about it in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling
