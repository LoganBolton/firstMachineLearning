what can i say about a tale such as this this magical tale has followed me from my early childhoodevoking warm memories in my heartthe characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene for example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drumsbr br the story line was wonderfuli wanted so badly for landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with mrbrownand find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the warbr br i am still a child insideand this movie appeals to my inner child like no other this movie is my definite favorite of all times i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept awayand transported into another time
