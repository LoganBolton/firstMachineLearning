this place in england during 1940 three orphans carrie charles and paul are sent to live with miss price angela lansbury she doesnt want them but reluctantly takes them in it seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the college of witchcraft oki realize this is a family film butcollege of witchcraft come on before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war  and she seeks down the head professor browne david tomlinson and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknobbr br i first saw this when i was 9 and vaguely remember loving it it sure doesnt hold up as an adult the story is silly even for a fantasy the kids are terrible actors and one of them charles is incredibly obnoxious also roddy mcdowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes theres also a trip to the isle of naboombu which is run by animated animals i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor for disney and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals there are a few saving graces here lansbury and tomlinson are just great the songs while forgettable are pleasant the long dance sequence on portobello road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscarwinning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end but the weak story line poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down i heard the extended version is even worse i can only give this a 7
