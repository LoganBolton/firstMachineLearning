if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure itd be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as im pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman or gaiman adaptation as it were it isnt the visual dreamscape of mirrormask it isnt the adult pretension of pans labyrinth and it isnt the funloving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasylover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should rejoicespecial effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production nowbr br the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however tristans fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and hes not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the stars heart can give and a brothers feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her directionbr br from there its all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warmhearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note deniros performance is spoton its not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a roughandgruff typecast character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniros own opening up into alternate forms of acting deniro hasnt been so unique to his own image since brazil and thats saying somethingbr br stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on childrens and fantasylovers shelves for a long time i cant say it offers anything new but its not really there to its actually those most familiar with its tropes that will enjoy it the mostbr br polarisdib
