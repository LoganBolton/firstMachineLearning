a great film the acting  from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute with very few exceptions was wonderful i thought soni razdanmrsnoble and vrajesh hirjeesaurabh were the best of the lesser known actors even kurush deboo tehmul who might be accused of overacting presented quite a believable and familiar characterbr br another great thing was the camera work  and the way it captured the energy of bombay streets the tranquility of gustad saying his prayers and life within the tiny apartmentsbr br i liked the story of the wall that becomes a shrine and then gets broken down  and the artists philosophical take on itbr br its great to see good movies on indian themes
