its really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow mounties and hockey players this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks the first was the red violin far better than all but the best hollywood effortsbr br gustad noble is anything but that he is a middleaged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family his friends and his work and their effect on him at the same time it is a fascinating and i would assume accurate portrayal of middleclass urban life in india at the timebr br however i was somewhat prepared for this having read rohinton mistrys book a few years ago the film as might be expected cannot capture all the complexities of the book but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good film read and see such a long journey
