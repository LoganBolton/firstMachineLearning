i saw this pilot when it was first shown and im sure countless spirit fans hate it because like batman the green hornet etc it took the character in the direction of camp but i evidently never got enough of batman because i thought it was entertaining in some of the same ways as that show there are two parts that stay with me first when dennys partner has been fatally wounded and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and obeying the exact letter of it then he says something like boy was i stupid which is his way of telling denny to become a vigilante instead which he does though the tv batman kind then theres the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her but she isnt fooled because hes too honest to kiss her convincingly  this was a great example of camp that was also underplayed by both the actor and actress
