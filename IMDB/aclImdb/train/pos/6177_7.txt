the adaptation of will eisners spirit to the tv screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages or comic books remember the two arent exactly the same medium it is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation as of the time of this writingof eisners smart alec wise cracking tongueincheek super herobr br story has it that republic pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in negotiation with the copyright owner in the mid 40s but they were never able to close the deal the left over screen play became the serial the masked marvel one of republics best perhaps that it was just as well for that studio had a penchant for tinkering with material adapted from the comic strips pulp mags radio and the comic booksbr br as for this 1987 made for tv movie its pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series whereas an old long time comic readerlike myself can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to give some fresh observations clear of any preconceived notions of what this screen version should look likebr br well while sitting and watching the story unfold with the characters interacting amid some crime wave the little lady my wife mrs ryan nailed it with one statement this cant make up its mind if its serious or not that pretty well describes both the spirit and his creator mr will eisner the true creative genius in the comicsbr br the film is a sincere attempt to put eisners world on the screen the casting of denny coltthe spirit commissioner dolan and ellen was really quite well done though in a contemporary setting it was still in the tradition of the good old days as far as the costuming goes you know when men and women still wore hats that brings up this one final and meandering point and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a will eisner look as far as facial expressions and body language we saykudos to them for their effortsbr br its just too bad that no series followed oh well in todays motion picture world comic adaptations seem to be a hot item maybe some big timer producer and director could do a really 1st class spirit production for the big screen we can only hopebr br update dateline chicago illinois 642008 by now everyone who goes to the movies at the shopping centre multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new film of the spirit subtitled my city screams which is to be released christmas day 2008 well well see then just what weve been talking about just keep your fingers crossed to be continuedbr br update ii we saw the new film writerdirector frank millers rendition of the spirit a couple of days ago well we got our wish but is this a good thing or another case of be careful what you ask for because you may get it please read our writeup elsewhere in imdbcom thanx
