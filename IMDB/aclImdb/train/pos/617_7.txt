greetings again from the darkness this one will be compared to the princess bride and although it doesnt measure up to that classic it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspensebr br charlie cox plays tristan who falls for the wrong girl sienna miller and agrees to fetch her a fallen star  who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes not much suspense on what happens with these two but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter otoole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our star is wearing lots of bad chasing the goodbr br along the way an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see including any from the carribbean robert deniro plays captain shakespeare  tough on the inside and shall we say in touch with his feminine side another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughsbr br not your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew vaughns layer cake effort deserves an audience sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money my guess it will find big success on video
