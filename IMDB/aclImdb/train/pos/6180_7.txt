during the opening night of the vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtainbr br i had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them this wouldnt be so bad if the music was half way decent but its not there is only one good song worse its as if the studio knew they had one song cocktails for two and were forced to endure four versions of it a duet a big production number as the vanities finale and in the background as incidental music i dont think spike jones and his city slickers ever played it that much the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie charles middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistressbr br by no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers or are willing to scan through them its a fun movie of the sort they dont make any more
