since this is black history month and im reviewing the achievements of many africanamericans on film in chronological order i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke ellington and his orchestra were in it their jazz version of franz liszts rhapsody was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mysterymusical comedy mixture many other numbers i liked were kitty carlisles especially sweet marijuana carl brissons cocktails for two as well as his duet with carlisle on that earlier and the ones by gertrude michael whos great as the woman you love to hate jack oakie and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their lovehate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you and toby wing is a sexy dumb tease as nancy who keeps trying to say something to oakie but gets a not now from him every time while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen i wasnt surprised by the revelation of who done it and get a load of how naked the women here are though of course their breasts are covered either by their hands or some flimsy top this was very obviously precode worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing ps as a longtime louisiana resident i like noting when someone was born here as carlisle was a new orleans native
