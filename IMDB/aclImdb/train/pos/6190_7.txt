fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartleys henry fool i havent seen the earlier film and i dont know if thats a good thing or not i can only regard the current film on its own meritsbr br for most people hal hartleys style of filmmaking is something that you either like or you dont his combination of action drama absurdity and dry ironic humour really resonates with me and fay grim is no exception it has an air of sharplywritten intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness its a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakesbr br during the second half of the film the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionageconspiracy thriller whether this was hartleys intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear but i think a bit of editing or rewriting to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the films original momentumbr br the performances were generally good particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum who had the most screen time saffron burrows james urbaniak carl montgomery and elina l√∂wensohn all played good support roles the films visuals were nice set in new york paris berlin and istanbul and the music also by hartley was good without being intrusive the film is wellwritten and i enjoyed this it immensely if you like hartleys earlier work youll probably like this
