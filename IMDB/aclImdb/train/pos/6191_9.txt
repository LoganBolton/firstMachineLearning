it seems hal hartleys films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences this film will be no exception to that rule fay grim acts as a sequel to hartleys henry foole from 1998 the focus this time is on henrys ex wife played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey who is being pestered by cia goons about henrys unpublished book about all of his shady dealings in the interim of all of this fay ends up on an odysseydealing with international spiesetc the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half if youve been a fan of hal hartley in the past this is one not to be missed for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one especially if you havent seen henry yet i admired the camera workwhich at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography
