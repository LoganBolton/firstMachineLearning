after seeing this film months ago it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that pointbr br i fell in love with hal hartleys directing many years ago  i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained it is a strange feeling granted and i assume most people out there really just dont get it or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable  i guess i just really get it  its as if these films were made for mebr br although i dont remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film it remains one of the funniest films ive seen in many years if you dont see the humor of the grocery bag fay carries from the street to a church to her brothers publishers office to her sons principals office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film the bag is a silent character in itself being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets herbr br i consider henry fool my least favorite of hartleys films i honestly dont remember it very well  i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious hartleys forte seems to be feminine character developmentbr br aside from poseys brilliance it was wonderful to see elina lowensohn one of my favorite actresses again her extravagant naivet√© is perfect for hartleys direction his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughoutbr br this film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story explaining political situations in afganistan this is never suspected at the beginning the complexity of this films development is unparalleledbr br this is the epitome of a stand alone sequel the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is spun around him the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film  as an alcoholic chainsmoking complaint machine hurling insults at his islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12yearold schoolyard bullybr br although i was impressed and satisfied with hartleys other recent films the girl from monday and no such thing fay grim goes far beyond what i expected with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare
