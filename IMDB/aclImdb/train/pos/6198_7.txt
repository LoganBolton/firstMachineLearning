im one of those people whod crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film from trust and iris to henry fool and my hartley favorite no such thing hals unique brand of movies are an acquired taste infusing equal parts mysteryespionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte the comedy isnt in your face necessarily and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition and thats the case with fay grim the sequel to henry foolbr br parker posey stars as fay grim abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henrys only son ned fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen his name is fulbright jeff goldblum man of the year and he wants henrys notebooks there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings apparently theres much more to them secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists who knows but henry agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry and it works but not the way they thinkbr br fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henrys notebooks and to seek him out she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon james urbaniak out of prison hed helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession spy rings shoot each other to death henry is discovered being held in safety by a jihadist fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her sons life and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in dangerbr br hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes and he does so to the extreme here even character names grim fool fulbright fogg have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny the overthetop espionage films of ol are given plenty of screen time too as guns blaze in stopmotion sequences never striking our heroine even though shes right in the line of firebr br now that ive heaped praise on this creation i will say that parker poseys excessive portrayal of fay grim isnt the best part of the film which is a shame considering how much time shes onscreen i realize this was probably what mr hartley wanted an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme but it was still painful to watch at timesbr br even so fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more though this wasnt my favorite hal hartley film i know im ready
