as someone who has seen and followed hartleys public work for several years i think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind gamesbr br while entertaining fay grim is another step in the henry fool line of thinking where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself in henry fool the object is the memoirs in fay grim the object is encrypted memoirs  which are themselves stolen forged and transmutated into something so obscure it cant really make any sense  ie the process of script writing and filmmaking in the modern era  where most blockbuster films are little more than a mashup of the past that is in a philosophical sense what fay grim is all about the object perhaps is the tragedy that shock is now clich√© and dull as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers officebr br that being said many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand henrys character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for henry is a thinly veiled devil first visiting simon as a modern faust etc without understanding how tragic henrys character is much of the quality of fay grims plot and story is lostbr br and there is not enough detail expressed through verbal flashbacks  knowing the plot of henry fool cannot compare to feeling the quality of the characters as one did in henry fool and so i think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of so what responses to highly constructed dialog and then thats itbr br however henry fool was also my least favorite hartley film until i realized that it was bad  putrid and infested  precisely because henry fools confessions were bad not just raunchy or dirty but inescapably broken henry can not even be a proper villain  and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing like gollum in tolkiens works henry is pitiablebr br that doesnt come across in fay grim although henrys dialog is excellent what does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption  a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henrys confessions it is an interesting twist but one that cant really be digested without viewing the first film perhaps showing more of henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie  although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about  unless perhaps one is a casual observerbr br part of the encryption hard to say a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though cheesy
