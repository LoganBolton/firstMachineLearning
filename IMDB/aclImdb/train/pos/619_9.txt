i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clich√© but i was completely wrong charlie cox i had never heard of him until now played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with himbr br claire danes who i did like before loved her in romeo and juliet made me enjoy her even more her acting was fantastic i couldnt even tell that she was american the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good the casting was quite perfectbr br robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally wellcasted deniro as that gay piratepriceless priceless i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the shipoh my god wow pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie br br overall it was funny but not slapstick at all romantic the special effects werent totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter otoole were also wellplaced br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out
