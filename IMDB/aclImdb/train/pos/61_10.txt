alright this film is the representation of several things for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries the lead character is what several people who consider a lonergoth despite the movies stating of her not being so she seems quite mysterious but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom shes questioned due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before anyhow shes a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society yet due to some at first unexplained events she spent roughly a year out of school failing the grade she has the desire to graduate and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor the girl in the hospitalbr br these two leads are nearly entirely opposite and they are quite that on a social level while alisha is a quiet inwardly disturbed antisocial goth girl who spends her time entirely alone even though she seems to read quite often somewhat of a closetout of the closet bookworm the other girl is a rich popular bubbly girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most cliques in the modern highschool but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thingbr br many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things either a snobby hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does taking it out on an innocent girl or the story of a seemingly trapped fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge but that she is actually perhaps one of the most intelligent people shes known in other words people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life but it isnt about thatbr br this film is about several things while it is about all i have stated it is also representative of how people deal from a large lifechanging catastrophe truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you arent afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculouslybr br overall this film is one of the best ive ever seen the acting is brilliant the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful and the emotion flowing throughout this film will have anyone not only relating but possibly crying this film is by far heartwrenching and very impactful and if i ever believed any film could alter a persons life this would be the first that could have changed minebr br i adored this movie if you ever want a movie thats moving and impactful while incredibly entertaining and real watch this
