henry fool is a better film but this is the perfect way to followup a film like henry fool to take henry very seriously his lies and his mysterious aura even the opening shot of henry fool when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through fay grim the overthetop jokes that are more or less metajokes about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them also hartleys use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring yes its intention but it feels forced and overused it goes beyond jarring to what id like to call annoying its a flawed film but a must see for any hartley or henry fool fan br br and dont listen to stupid reviews dont watch this unless youve seen the first film the intrigue satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you havent seen henry fool its a sequel thats just dumb
