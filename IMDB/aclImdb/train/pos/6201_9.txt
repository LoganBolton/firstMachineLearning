hal hartleys henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work it has immense character depth subtle complicated dialogue and an excellent emotional ending which captivates i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish and needed no sequelbr br thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of realworld vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures in her own movie fay matures herself though her maturity takes a very different road simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhatintroverted genius fay starts her adult journey as an immature utterly normal spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature utterly normal experienced adult who holds no advantages she deals with problems the way any human does with determination a little thought and weary disdain while simon learned to control his mind fay learns to control her emotionbr br the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel but differs vastly in tone for most of the film henry fool showed you a harsh boring ignorant world which contrasted with simons inner passion and creativity in fay grim the world is a lively crazy emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak motherbr br the movie is in two parts the first dealing with the beginning of fays struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry at first fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies the sequel is about fays journey and as i said before hers is one of finding the lifegiving sanity in chaos not the creative chaos in staid order parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartleys tongue in cheek humor perfectly elina l√∂wensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively stagelike comedy happening around herbr br with the entrance of henry into the picture the movie begins to take a sobering turn hal hartleys movies are all plays and every play must come full circle by the end you are shown fays newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meetsbr br fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool but shows through hals range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his geniusbr br honestly i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile and especially the subtlety in parker poseys acting but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool
