when i started watching fay grim i had no idea that it was a sequel to henry fool now the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel but one has arrived and its quite good i assume that youve seen the original so i wont explain it this one starts with fay parker posey living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry thomas jay ryan simon james urbaniak is still in jail one day the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school but this is no ordinary toy it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than syrianabr br i must say that im quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here maybe this one doesnt quite reach the originals quality but it certainly takes a good look at whats going on in the world and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequelbr br also starring jeff goldblum
