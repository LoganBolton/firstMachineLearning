perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasnt so attached to the characters in henry fool to those whove never seen henry fool i wouldnt worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanationsbr br this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartleys trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartleys later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i dont know if hartleys talents are suited to such big subject matter or if hes able to do it justicebr br strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is ive seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henrys books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fays motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry foolbr br i guess im slightly disappointed in the film because its not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesnt exactly work as a straight ahead thriller theres too much irony and wryness in hartleys approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartleys work and how well you know hartleys work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride
