im an admirer of hal hartleys films especially 1997s henry fool fay grim is a sequel to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor the plot however is completely different fay grim played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey tries to track down her missing husbands notebooks and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage the supporting cast most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum saffron burrows and a muchwelcomed return from 90s indiedarling elina lowensohn is excellent and the film has lots of surprises the director claims this is part of a star warslike trilogy serving as the empire strikes back of the series if this is true i cant wait to see the third installment i just hope i dont have to wait 10 more years for it
