i just saw this film  tiff toronto international film festival fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed and if you are not familiar with this directors oeuvre  doesnt matter this film can definitely stand all on its own i have to go the second screening  it was amazing i need to see it again  and fast br br this film is very funny its dialogue is very smart and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool 2000 visually the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted or dutch angle which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts available in the possible films short works by hal hartley 19942004 collection and in the girl from monday 2005br br i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th textually fay grims adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11 2001 without going into major spoilers i view this work and storyworld as a bravely political and original portrait of geopolitics that is rarely if ever foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post911 heretofore cf syrianna of side note  mark cuban exec prod in both these films  most interesting to say the least br br lastly for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool simone fay and henry this film is hilariously selfconscious and selfreferential that being said the character of fay grimm starts off in the film exactly where she was when henry fool ended but by the end of the film  fays knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family   i cant wait for the third part in this story
