when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool i was excited its been a personal favorite for years now and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism having just seen it though i was surprised to find that it worked while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superbespecial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast right down to henrys son who was only four in the original like i said though this movie is quite different from the first but it works i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended in this case an unexpected adventure ensuesand thats about all ill give awaynot to mention the fact that ill need to see it again to really understand whats going on and whos double crossing who while it was certainly one of the better movies ive seen in some time it suffers like many sequels with its ending as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging ill be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 henry grim in 2017
