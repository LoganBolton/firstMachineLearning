the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman writer of mirrormask and its really a good story i think it would appeal to any labyrinth princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet its totally unique and stands up on its own and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman i wont spoil it for youbr br the main character tristan tristran in the novel is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and some bickering princesbr br its a really good story it has humor and magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visuals its charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages its simply magical its a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i havent seen in cinema since the 1980s
