plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie but follow the fleets screenplay is exceptionally mediocre fred and ginger still come off all rightthey play bake baker and sherry martin dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy when they meet again their lovehate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments but for much of the movie they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherrys sister connie harriet hilliard her love for sailor bilge smith randolph scott bilges dalliance with another woman and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father though hilliard is rather charming this plot is uninterestingbr br but at the same time follow the fleet is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents astaire gets two good solos with we saw the sea and id rather lead a band he sings expressively and of course dances electrifyinglyand the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual rogers sings the catchy let yourself go and later does a solo tapdance to the same tune br br the three duets really save the film even though theyre all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of let yourself go later they sing and dance im putting all my eggs in one basket as if it were an early rehearsal of the number flubbing the choreography to comic effect at the end the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duetit makes it part of a showwithintheshow the situation is contrived but the song lets face the music and dance is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote its reminiscent of cole porter and the dancing matches it in elegance quintessential astaire and rogersbr br it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of follow the fleet again and in fact its not necessary because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers but i could watch the songs over and over
