what an entertaining movie astaire and randolph scott are in the navy astaire has to woo back ginger in san francisco while scott must be persuaded that harriet hilliard is worthy of being his wife everything works out finebr br its sometimes argued and i can see why that scotts romance with hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down especially painful are hilliards singing of sappy love songs i could have done without her singing right enough but i found the romance rather touching hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher wearing a pair of spectacles no makeup and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast no wonder scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister ginger and a slinky lucille ball the problem is that after her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before only with a glossier outfit its tough enough for a homely guy but at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular then he can collect women anyway even if he looks like jojo the dogfaced boy but what does a plainlooking woman do the same avenues to romance arent open to her henry kissinger had groupies did margaret thatcher it must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours as a kind of a footnote i must mention that randolph scott was rumored to be bisexual by hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on and its kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when hes putting homely hilliard off  women dont interest me sister the movie probably gives more quality time to ginger rogers than any of her other films with astaire and shes marvelous shes beautiful sexy a talented actress and dancer and the script gives her good comic lines too lets kiss and make up suggests astaire lets just make up she says that will give you something to work on its also the only film she made with astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition choreographed by hermes pan her performance is accidentally sabotaged by astaire who slips some alka seltzer or something into her water and she hiccups through her number burping being too indelicate for the timebr br as a dancer id make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur but i think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film their first during a dancing contest let yourself go is the most wildly exuberant of any i can remember and the only dramatic duet lets face the music and dance must be among their finest the last step as they exit is startlingbr br i like the film for reasons with personal resonance i remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown san diego next to a shop called the seven seas that catered to sailors i was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of astaire and scott what i mean is here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality and yet unlike most of their other teamings pays its dues anyway jumping ship astaire calls out for a water taxi i had just taken a water taxi ashore myself the uniforms are correct to the period unlike say those in on the town and theyre worn properly hats down to two fingerwidths above the eyebrow and not cocked back and there are two incidents in which astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and theyre both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable an officer stops astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain they were playing when the call was sounded sir im certain no breach of discipline was intended its what an officer  a good officer  would say and nobody laughsbr br the series was getting a little repetitious by the time follow the fleet was made so instead of putting fred into high society and a tuxedo they turned him into a gumchewing swabbie instead it was a good idea and the dance numbers are up to the concept
