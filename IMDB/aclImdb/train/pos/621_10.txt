as a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of neil gaiman in particular ive been looking forward to this film so avidly so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe its finally here and you know what i neednt have feared the film version is bldy awesome different from the book but in a good way  less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchantingbr br the special effects are absolutely spoton and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusivebr br proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly princes whose rollcall read almost as a whos who of currently cool british comedy  rupert everett david walliams of little britain fame two of the blokes from green wing etc stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films funniest moments which exist in abundance br br in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ricky gervais cameo for example was far too much just ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story though in fairness from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty ricky gervaisesquire when i think back on itbr br but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance charlie cox as the protagonist tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and selfrealisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on lifechanging quest claire danes as yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun looks like hes having a ball too and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia my favourite performance of the film overall if you enjoyed her deliciously btchy performance in the recent hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this toobr br so to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry  stardust is a beautiful heartwarming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass n smarts than is immediately apparent one of my alltime favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongueincheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions or equivalent future device for many years to come
