this really is a great movie some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever but basically all of fred and gingers movies are the same after the singing and dancing is over its the other characters in the movie who make the movie work what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again he adds to this movie he doesnt detract from it he has a winning personality and a great smile randy is in my top ten all time favorites list its great to see him as something other than a cowboy ok so he isnt really a great actor but like so many other stars errol flynn alan ladd victor mature etc he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions all of fred and gingers movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him
