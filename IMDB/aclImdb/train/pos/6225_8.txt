this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astairerogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied andor shared between the principals as usual the storyline neednt detain us though for the record it was based on a play shore leave that also served as the basis for a broadway musical hit the deck anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters as always is the music lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle its a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 we get to see astaire play the piano  in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs one of which im building up to an awful letdown had a lyric by johnny mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts  and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman albeit an exhoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts he gets to perform a littleknown but excellent berlin number id rather lead a band as well as duetting on im putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic  in 1936 rumbles of world war ii were already being felt  lets face the music and dance one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fishoutofwater without either a horse or a sixgun within easy reach and harriet hilliard doesnt exactly set the screen on fire we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is do they deliver answer in spades
