one of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue sorted out happily kind of plot it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too the dialogue is not as zippy as top hat for example and randolph scott seems out of placebr br there are compensations it has some of irving berlins choicest songs including let yourself go im putting all my eggs in one basket and lets face the music and dance it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they dont disappoint here they do a snappy tap dance a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance all in the same film great versatility and artistrybr br it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role she had a varied career becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie here she is touching without being sentimentalher two songs are simply and effectively delivered she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film br br more tightening up have made the film even better pretty good though
