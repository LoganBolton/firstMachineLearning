while i dont consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her ageugly makeup in the beginning and end robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain whos forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky gervais peter otoole and many others do fine work here while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties theres also stunning faces of sienna miller olivia grant as girl bernard and kate magowan especially when we first meet her newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan actually ben barnes many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances the main difference was that with pb you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson stardust makes you believe for the most part that what youre seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout so on that note i highly recommended stardust
