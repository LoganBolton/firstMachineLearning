1936 was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection  mark sandrichs follow the fleet this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where sherry martin rogers is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyones ear yep you guessed it  theyre hot for each other once again only this time sherrys spinster sister connie harriet hillard threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bakes robust seafaring buddy bilge smith randolph scott a sort of use em up and toss em out kind of guy thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic classy score including standards let yourself go im putting all my eggs in one basket and lets face the music and dance the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger br br the transfer on follow the fleet is a tad weaker the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now its a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles grain is still present so are age related artifacts once youve settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage the audio is mono but very nicely balanced extras include a featurette theatrical trailer and short subject but oddly  no audio commentary considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astairerogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video
