one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films great music by irving berlin solid support from randolph scott harriet nelson lucille ball betty grable frank jenks and astrid allwynbr br terrific songs include let yourself go lets face the music and putting all my eggs in one basket the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers rogers also sings let yourself go with grable among the backup singersbr br harriet nelson then hilliard sings two nice songs and plays rogers mousy sister get thee behind me is a song that sticks with you for days she also sings but where are you snappy and fast paced this entry in the astairerogers series is one of the better ones the classic and amazing beautiful finale lets face the music and dance is among the bestknown of their numbers rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances weighted hem and is also slightly see through just gorgeous this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters recreated in pennies from heavenbr br randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaires pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact allwyn has the bigger role but is only okbr br rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with let yourself go jazzy and thumping its a great songbr br fun all the way although i got tired of we joined the navy after the third time
