musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer this time harriet hilliardbr br randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an exvaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner but now the two are on shore leave fred and ginger take up right where they left off and randy accidentally meets gingers dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty but randys a typical love em and leave em sailor br br again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to but the real hit of the show is lets face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair lets face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen their dancing on this one is absolute magicbr br im sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson thats right ozzie and harriet its something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and rickys mom on television then again she didnt even keep her own name br br neither ozzie or harriet sang on television ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer but harriet could really carry a tune she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here but where are you both with real feeling and class i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today
