this is my alltime favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like im putting all my eggs in one basket and lets face the music and dance if i remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart sorry for the sentimental crp but im woman so get over itall in all this film gets an 810 from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome
