this is one of the best fred astaireginger rogers films or at least one of my favorites most of the ar movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other filmsbr br this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs the music is the central theme here and whats nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure she dances also with fred of course and theyre always a fun pair to watch on the dance floorbr br growing up in the 1950s watching ozzie  harriet on television it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty although she had that short early 30s hairstyle i recognized her voice right away also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball i cant find her but i know shes in herebr br astaire except for some obnoxious gumchewing in the first third of the film was fun to watch and randolph scott  although better in westerns  is likable toobr br this is simply a nice feelgood film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers
