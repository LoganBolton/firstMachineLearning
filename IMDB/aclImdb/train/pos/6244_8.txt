every country which has a working film industry has some sane and maybe some insane artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when youre a part of this country i guess hundstage is such a moviebr br you see the lowest level of austrias society dirty disturbed weird hateful but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them normal because theyre doing it through their whole life from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austrias art moviesbr br but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society a society that is going more insane from day to day creating their own rules that nobody else can understand cave the social system from within and you see the people sitting in the park standing at the opposite street corner queuing in the same line maybe you meet em in a bar or a disco you may visit maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house you start to hate them without exactly knowing why youll try to get away  but you cannot maybe youll end up like them but it seems normal for you because youre doing it through your whole life nowbr br life isnt so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world it has beautiful people but some are also ugly there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so farbr br a very pessimistic movie
