its not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if youre not 100 sure of your mental stability because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film so the majority of the viewers wouldnt have the level of maturity to reach in to its delightful side kind of like tarkovsky films but different in a way i myself cant say i had a lot of fun watching it but its an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich√© that hollywood offers hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over you cant simply sit back and watch it youll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film a film thats similar to this in style is nachtgestalten but it was considerably better and way less violent this one for instance is not for children or those who are mentally tender or badtempered most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film i give it a 9 because ive seen the multiplestoriesinonefilm phenomenon in another film and it was better but this ones an outstanding piece on its own worth watching but get ready to see something disturbing
