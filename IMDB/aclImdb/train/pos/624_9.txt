the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy br br in case you dont want to read further down the page there arent any spoilers ill sum it up here its more mature than ella enchanted there are some questionably violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for small children but doesnt try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and youll be close br br br br i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active im also a huge scififantasy fan i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 and this film is the diamond in the roughbr br by the end here august i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly warybr br as many others here i was utterly surprised i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clich√©d from here to breakfast dont be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that its not based on anything ive seen or read in the past 15 years and its actually a really good moviebr br unlike 90 of the other movies which seem to persistently reappear like thorns in a side perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas i could read a book this year and in two years the movie would be out as another epic fantasy tale the likes of lotr and the rest so says the nyt and such and such no doubtbr br stardust didnt have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom it didnt even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to whats happening on screen transformers im looking at you its not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i couldve figured them out in 3rd grade boy i hate those br br i just watched watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that it even made my heart twinge at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when id gone inbr br it truly is a gem after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work id done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my moneys worthbr br its probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone princess bride black cauldron the dark crystal etc then you should really see this movie this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on thisbr br simply wonderful
