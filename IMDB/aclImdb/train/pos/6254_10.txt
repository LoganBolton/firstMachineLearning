i just saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival the working title there was dog days the audience reaction was mixed some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this film wasbr br this film isnt for the faint of heart its like happiness with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity theres animal poisoning a striptease from a senior citizen an orgyesque bathouse in a shopping centre anal candle penetration and the molestation of the mentally incompetentbr br if any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film isnt for you this film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic the banality of our existence is shoved in our face with utmost gleebr br  seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here and why should he this film features excellent performances from all involved is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film in awhile
