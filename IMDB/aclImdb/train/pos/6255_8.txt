this film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in austria it shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with othersbr br in the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film and rightly so because the film is not and easy one to watch it has a very depressing message and there isnt any moment of mercy in the film it is a very cruel movie not for everyones taste you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film it grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensitybr br i can not recommend or not recommend this film you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyones taste
