they probably could have skipped some of the beginning  im not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey if it was because starting in the mediterranean they could have gotten closer starting in modern day lebanonbr br one the cameras and crews get to the bakhtyari tribe its the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey 50000 people with about 250000 goats camels cattle and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving karun river they use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins  you can see where the head and legs were removed the other bank of the river was very steep  im guessing about a 60 degree risebr br just watching that was incredible but there was much more to come to get to the pastures they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow if not more being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself but they and all of the animals climbed this mountain barefoot yes barefootbr br the one drawback to this documentary were some of the intertitles with poor attempts at humorbr br if you want to see a documentary from the silent era or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face but conquer this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges
