this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wowbr br it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaimans faultbr br sure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart flowed smoothlyand made the characters completely believablebr br i could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as tristan claire daines is brilliant as yvaine and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespearebr br the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80s sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great moviebr br special effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectlybr br then there is the story what can i say how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesnt just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same timebr br any one of those things would have made this a good movie all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well once again neil gaiman has done it he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it i didnt want it to end i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person to travel its fields and valleys stroll through its marketplaces and meet its residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman the sandman american gods coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no differentbr br in the end im sure that neils writing and this movie wont have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
