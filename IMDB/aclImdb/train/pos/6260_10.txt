this was soulprovoking i am an iranian and living in th 21st century i didnt know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfatherbr br you see that today or even in 1925 on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and ondemand but here 80 years ago people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass its really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep but they lose many the sheep on their waybr br i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe they were as tough as bakhtiari people
