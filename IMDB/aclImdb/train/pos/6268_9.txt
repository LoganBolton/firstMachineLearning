carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them although the story isnt strong the action is fun and draws you to the very end which i felt couldve had a sequelbr br campy and dark this is great ol skool kung fu
