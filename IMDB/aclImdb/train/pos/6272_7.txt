br br i saw once no mans land 1987  imdb link httpusimdbcomtitle0093638  and found it ok the film is about a guy who steals only porsches gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it in fact it has a lot of scenes that are worthless and the ending is very very badbr br the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used
