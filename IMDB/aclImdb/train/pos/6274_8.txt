i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night i didnt really hear much about it so i wasnt expecting anything but after i saw it i really liked it nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good but i do have to say giovanni ribisis acting performace did need a little perking up but such a small flaw it could be overrided br br gone in 60 seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brothers life the movie is in no way predictable so the ending should be a suprise think its just another fast car driving movie well you are partially right there is much more to it everyone should take a look at this movie
