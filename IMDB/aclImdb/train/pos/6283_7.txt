as much as i like big epic pictures  ill spare you the namedropping  its great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a backseat to the setpieces films where the dialogue isnt so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better onesbr br its an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that pictures ethos but not quite its execution whatever was great about the original has been streamlined whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster  see the pugugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it  but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeedsbr br the plot and much of the dialogue isnt much to write imdb about often youll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that its also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol saint nick the stalwart see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice momentsbr br the villain is not even a little scary  ive seen chris eccleston play toughguy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow were just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far incheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldnt have minded some fourthwall breaking winks at the camera its just that kind of moviebr br all this style and not so much substance  something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so  would be worthless if the action wasnt there and for the most part it is wonderfully so ive noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fastcut extreme closeup shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing exhausting i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time ive been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean  his character clearly doesnt care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slowburning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish  and fun  way possiblebr br so yes this movie isnt an epic lifeaffirming post911 picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these commentsbr br id take it over the numerous iterations of the flaccid and the tedious guess the franchise any day 710
