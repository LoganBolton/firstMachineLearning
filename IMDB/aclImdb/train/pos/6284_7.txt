to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip giovanni ribsi a car thief who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars 50 in total he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days with the help of randall nicolas cage a retired booster and also kips brother and a couple of old friends of randalls as you can see this is the same old big bro needs to get lil bro out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of but at times it is predictable too so there is nothing fancy about the story br br you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff since there are only 50 beautiful fast cool and expensive cars to be stolen well the other hot item in this film is sway angelina jolie who will be a big star trust me she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft but she is pretty hot too ok not hot as in pretty but hot as in damn cool and sexy she was very believable in this role probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too dont believe me read her biography and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man i only know that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film because she is not too mainstream a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoobr br ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was that there is not very much action there is one totally unrealistic scene the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes hey but after seeing the whole film i must say who cares why must i say that well because it was still entertaining had a couple of cool car chases good music some bruckheimer scenes where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet good actors who all did their jobs pretty cars one cool wild sexy lady yes i mean mrs jolie and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood endingbr br as for nicolas cage well he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock con air face  off snake eyes and finally this one plus what actor has had so many good action  thrillers in the last years and such successful ones  well no one maybe jackie chan but he is one of my favourites too one thing that is true though about mr cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse the rock was a clear 9 con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7 not that that mark is bad does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies  no it doesnt show us that because almost all of cages films were successful in the last few years except for 8mm and bringing out the dead 8mm was not great i admit that but that was never cages fault and the story seemed good to me about the latter film i can not say anything cause i have not seen it yet one thing though i know for sure if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films i would have said yes to all of them i would have said yes to the rock because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris i would have said yes to con air because there would be a lot of action in it because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie cant wait to see her in that lara croft outfit this one was a good choice of mr cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatrebr br 7 out of 10
