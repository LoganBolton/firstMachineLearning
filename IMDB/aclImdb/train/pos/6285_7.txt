whats in a name if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with actionbr br in producer bruckheimers latest film gone in 60 seconds its all about the nomenclature with character monikers like kip sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane sue and the elusive eleanor its only the nonstop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name gamebr br not a deep script by any means but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines along with angelina jolie and robert duvall comes out of carthievery retirement to save his brothers life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night a remake of the 1974 cult hit this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertainingbr br surprisingly its the action that keeps you watching not the acting although loaded with stars none of them have standout performances including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers giovanni ribisi even jolie coming off her recent oscar win is just a token love interest with hardly any screen timebr br can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film i think so the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity the action is nonstop and the suspense is compelling just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatrebr br 3 12 out of 5
