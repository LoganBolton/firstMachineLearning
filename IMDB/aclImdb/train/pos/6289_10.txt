this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cages career the thing i dont think people get is that its not meant to be an epic oscar contender of a movie its just some brilliant bruckbuster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack  it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything ferraris mercs a hummer and lets not forget eleanor i think youd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe thats just me
