buster absolutely shines in this episode which is the only vehicle ive seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical and silent comedy that made him famous its still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences  his voice is about the only thing i dont care for as far as buster is concerned  but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled he even repeats some of the gags used in his early tworeelers with roscoe arbucklebr br my deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode and for giving busters genius full scope he didnt have much time one episode to do it in but this is a touching tribute to hollywoods greatest genius
