my friends and i were just discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic comedys are being made we feel offended by the schlock that hollywood is serving up these days as they act like all is wellbr br well all is not wellwith the exception of a few bright spots like this movie it doesnt have the big name actors the big budget i dont think it had a big release i rented from hollywood video it didnt really have anything that most big budget romantic comedys havebr br but it did have what most of those lack it had great chemistry between the love interests parker jonathan schaech and sam alison eastwood their love story wasnt forced on us like so many the director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other their story reminded me of one of my favorites tootsiebr br the supporting cast added not only really funny comic moments but depth to the story as well james legros character was absolutely priceless sams gay friend was hysterical parkers interaction with his fellow employees in a psychic hotline was a lot of funbr br i laughed i cried i remembered how great it feels to fall in love
