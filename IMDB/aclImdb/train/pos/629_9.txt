the 14 yearold in me is immensely happy that theyre now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that theyre all the rage what with lord of the rings harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office this year will see and already has seen several more most notably the golden compass which has the most exciting trailer ive seen this year stardust based on a novel by neil gaiman showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep i saw no previews for it only a couple of commercials the critical reaction is kind of blah i wouldnt even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend well if youll forgive the horrible pun the stars must have been rightly aligned because i went to see stardust and i loved it its not a huge movie like lord of the rings the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest the hero sets out to look for a fallen star filled with obstacles but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative its simply aiming to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance and it succeeds wonderfully there were a lot of big films this summer but none of them were nearly as fun as this one theres a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent it isnt a masterpiece but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has though i dont like it quite as much as the earlier film a lot of fun to be had here if youre a fan of the genre
