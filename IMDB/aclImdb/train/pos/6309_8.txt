i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnightbr br welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off its a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook cosimo played by luis guzman who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison while in prison he meets a lifer who tells him of the ultimate bellini  which to you and me  is a surefire get rich quick scheme it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions sounds simple  well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride  word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos bellini lead by failed boxer pero superbly played by sam rockwell  surely a star in the making and reluctant crook riley william h macy who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraudbr br based on the italian film i soliti ignoti big deal on madonna street which also inspired a similar film to collinwood  palookaville this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker
