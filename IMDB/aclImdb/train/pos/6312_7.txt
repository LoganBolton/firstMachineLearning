before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut confessions of a dangerous mind they starred together in this movie george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer along with steven soderbergh which shows that they really believed in this project in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project that is in the same line with movieremakes such as oceans eleven and the italian job but somehow this movie is only halve successful or at least it isnt as good as it could had beenbr br the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie the fact that they are being played doesnt change much to this even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying or anything like that at allbr br its of course due to the writing that the characters arent used to their full potential i can only assume that the original italian movie i soliti ignoti works out much better than this movie does the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytellingbr br nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity its an harmless little caper movie in which you simply shouldnt to worry much about the story in that regard welcome to collinwood is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose wellbr br its a movie that you wont regret watching once youve finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeingbr br 710
