welcome to collinwood is a lot of things but it is none of the followingbr br a george clooney star vehicle unfunny unoriginalbr br and yes i know the basis for the movie is another movie but as far as hollywood goes this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade  and for me it doesbr br the movie is from start to finish an absolute gas heres whybr br there isnt a bad performance in the film the funny parts are funny the edgy parts are edgy the script contains not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful and it doesnt conform to the hollywood norm youll see what i mean when you see the filmbr br when i was a kid i remember seeing advertisements for the film this film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office and isnt even a cult classic the reason why transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by average movie goers is because they are used to seeing transformers 2 if films as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multimillion pieces of st the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place  br br when they say they dont make em like they used to they didnt see welcome to collinwoodbr br a fun minimasterpiece of caper comedy that refuses to compromise one of my favourites
