this movie was recommended to me by a friend i never saw an ad or a trailer so i didnt know clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small i thought the whole cast was suitable and found the film pretty enjoyable all in all the opening scene with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road looking whipped and haggard caught my attention immediately it had a way of telling you dont go away this wont be boring and it really wasnt it turned out to be an interesting lighthearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat to the very end but when the ending did arrive i felt a little bit cheatedjust a little bit the events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building but at a point that i cant define it sort of levels out making the ending a slight disappointment i reckon i expected a bigger bang of a climax but it turned out sort of lowkey if you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high dosages of george clooney you should find this flick very entertaining and well worth watching now id like to see the original big deal on madonna street but its probably a rare find in the united states
