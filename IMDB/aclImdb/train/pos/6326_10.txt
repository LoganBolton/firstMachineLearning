having first watched the movie at 14 i remember being struck by hearing the word govno sht for the first time ever on the thenstillsoviet tv i bet it really was the first time in history  anyone wants to add this to trivia section what an open boldness and freedom i thought as years passed i was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept diametrically opposite to my 14yo impression helplessness theres an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie of primitive degenerate tide embodied by sharikov sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas its a great metaphor of russian revolution in general inspired by intellectuals ashamed of their superiority and hoping to upgrade the lower classes only to unleash the power of mediocrity and get swallowed by it an extremely fine and talented piece wrapping a truly sad idea in a brilliantly satiric and elegant form symbolically enough the movie itself marked the end of the soviet movie traditions era before the hollywood tsunami had knocked them over  for good it seems judging by most current russian movies most of them labeled blockbusters in prerelease trailers and postersbr br funnily that govno episode is in no contradiction to efenstors comment above re rude language of current generation from what ive already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this but it was not a mild word by current standards it was way too rude back then and just rude enough to show the true nature of all sharikovs btw re efenstors lament it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon especially for russian speakers where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation but i join in regret that all the meaning in todays teenagers talk may be expressed by cusswords i feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium thats most efficient for the task well this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it
