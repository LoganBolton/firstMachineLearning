it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing if you loved bulgakovs book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an artfilm project than for actually bringing the storys deeper meaning to the screen there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita as complex and farfetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakovs work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a scorewith not a note missed why cant we find such talent here in the us  so now my favorite book and movie have the same title
