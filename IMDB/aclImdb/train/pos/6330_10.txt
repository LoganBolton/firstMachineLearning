this movie and yes its a movie  it was shot as a twoparter but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema a very wellmannered and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it the film is a faithful adaptation of the longbanned eponymous book by mikhail bulgakov the sets are flawless and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia adding a feel of authenticity where a late80s washedout color incarnation would have all but ruined the film i wont say much about the plot which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself but the performances are true oscar material special mentions go out to e evstigneev who plays the old professor with such presence gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture he ends up stealing every scene hes in the second of course is creaturesharikov who played to horrifying perfection by v tolokonnikov is by far more frightening a character than hannibal lecter because not only does he exist in real life  entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history with all that ensuesbr br while its a socio political allegory it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor albeit dark  there are many outright comedies which havent made me laugh as much as this film whats more when laughing at this movie the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement which is always a plusbr br there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie  the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectualbourgeois snobbery i caught at times from the enlightened characters but thats a minor quibblebr br sadly this film appears to have been bypassed by western licensing companies its a crying shame that one of the allround best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated which shouldnt be incredibly hard  though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation the films main themes should be accessible to all while were waiting with our fingers crossed for the criterion edition im considering creating english subtitles myself will see how that works out
