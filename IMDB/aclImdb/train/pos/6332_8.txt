this movie is good for tv i like it because im a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film accuracy on the film from the book is halfandhalf they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser the the car scene involving the hatch family running away from the tornado wasnt in the book instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety and in the book dan and his friend are both 12years old thats all i can think of overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small nebraska town in 1980
