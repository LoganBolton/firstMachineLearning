this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story that in itself is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fallin nebraska i wonder if the real towns name was close to blainsworth which is the towns name in the movie there is an ainsworth nebraska but there is also a town that starts with blainssomethingbr br it does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house on the other hand the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact before doppler radar and weather radio we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel not on cable and tuned the brightness just right you could tell if there was a tornado coming the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it br br since i know something about midwest tornadoes it made this movie fun for me i enjoy it more than twister i mean give me a breakthere is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house
