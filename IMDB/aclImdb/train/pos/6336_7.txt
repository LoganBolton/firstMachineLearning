ok so the fx are not high budget but this story is based on actual events not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors even richer as most movies that are based on books there are somethings that just dont fit only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events not a knockoff as most people believe it is this movie is in no way related too twister other than both movies are about tornadoesbr br for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie there are a couple of things you need to remember the actual night of the twisters was june 3 1980 so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events try think how far storm research has advanced in that time it happened in a larger town grand island nebraska is the third largest city in the state even though the movie calls the town something else and says its a small town for the real story check out httpwwwgitwisterscom
