stardust another guarded review originally written june 15 2007br br the marketing machine has only just begun for this one no site yet wth so i doubt most of you have heard about it in truth i hadnt either sort of when i got the posting i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal moviegoer turns out it wasnt transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as that neil gaiman movie what is it about well in short its a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star any more than that and id be giving away plot info which is a a breach of contract and b spoiling your fun if you really want to know what its about go buy the book rumour has it gaiman might be something of a writerbr br not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile and for this one it certainly was this screening was special in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors they rarely have a mixed screening and local scififantasy folks so you know the expected audience right i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expectbr br oh how sweetly wrong i wasbr br yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom but it was not lord of rings it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe ahem eragon it was much more intimate than all thatbr br but like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities its surely a romantic tale but with generous splashes of humour and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism its more along the lines of dramedy than comedy before i go on lets do this movie review thingbr br acting is in the very least good its always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles michelle pfieffer is not sadly one of those she plays a villain and she does the job nothing special rupert everett though he was a real jerk that is a great villain peter otoole is well peter frickin otoole  which is marvelous ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did and charlie cox who as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i aint never heard ofbr br claire danes claire danes claire danes ive always been of mixed opinion with her she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark in this shes the former and she is quite literally the star of this film sure her accent stumbles here and there and yes shes not as good as she can be when cox isnt in the scene however  well see for yourselfbr br special effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be best flying ship yet  sorry potter direction is lighthearted and flows nicely cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand all else is top bracketbr br and now that thats donebr br the writing oh the writing neil you devil its hard in todays climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest or three  whats new but gaimans story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart and though you suspect how its all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and  if youre me  find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best in the end youll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not fantastical and realbr br i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i wont ruin it for you for those who read the book rest assured its done properlybr br those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new withheld for this generation the blank gets filledin only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it youll know when you walk out anyway i sincerely hope stardust doesnt get lost among the tentpoles even if it does itll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i knowbr br br br forgot to add the withheld reveal im a few years late but  a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation br br perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but im still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride
