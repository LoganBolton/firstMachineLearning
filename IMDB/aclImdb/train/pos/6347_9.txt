how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw itbr br screenwriters jeffery price  peter s seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen ron howards direction brought the story to full life and jim carreys typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the showbr br some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story having read the original story i must say i cannot agree the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he wasbr br mild spoilers they probably wouldnt ruin the movie for you but if you havent seen it yet and youre one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until youve seen it you should skip the next two paragraphsbr br i think just about everyone can relate to the grinchs terrible experiences in school i think all of us at one time or another were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on i know i was and thats why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went throughbr br and cindy lou whos naive idealism believing that nobody can be all bad was heart rending when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance cindy lou was determined to be his friend if only everyone could have such an attitudebr br in fact i think the only thing that mightve made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content it was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whoviers cleavage just doesnt fit in a story like thisbr br this ones well on its way to being a christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a mustsee of every christmas season
