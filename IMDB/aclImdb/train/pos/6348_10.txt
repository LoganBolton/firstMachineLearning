jim carrey is good as usual and even though there are quite a few jim carrey moments its definitely not a jim carrey moviebr br its targeted mostly at children and i managed to enjoy it as such movie it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointedbr br the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids i cant say i loved this movie but then again im not its target audience
