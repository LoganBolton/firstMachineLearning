i already loved how the grinch stole christmas when it was released and im still loving it now 5 years later still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came outbr br sure the movie is overthetop and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch all of the sets costumes and characters are done perfectly overthetop in a fun way without ever becoming truly ridicules its a visually spectacular movie to watch its a campy movie making at its very best director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas moviebr br main reason why the movie works and why its so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing makeup which also received an academy award of course if youre a jim carrey hater you shouldnt even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinchbr br the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps its because im dutch and we dont really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honestbr br the musical score by james horner is good and fun even though its your average every day horner stuff it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scenes workbr br perfect christmas entertainmentbr br 810
