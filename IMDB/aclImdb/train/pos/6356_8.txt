i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movieit wasnt horrible nor was it great but it was enjoyable to watchi felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at timesthey made the grinch seem like a special education person when all he needed to be was evil and devious but yet he turned out kind of retardedi did think the scenery when not inside the grinchs cave was beautiful and there was a few parts where i laughed but most of the time i thought it was just annoyingthis movie couldve been so much better if they had changed the grinchs personality and they had included some more laugh scenes because most of the humor wasnt funnyi liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway but its not anything to get excited about seeing
