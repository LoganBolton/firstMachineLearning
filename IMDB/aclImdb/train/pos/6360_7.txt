i have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run downbr br why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to bebr br this film is supposed to be a light hearted tonge in cheek family comedy things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults and that is exactly what this film doesbr br i laughed my nuts off at this film i thought carey put in a great performance and the whole film if watched at christmas really give you a bit of festive cheerbr br so to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not taxi driver or the godfather and take films for what they are supposed to be entertainment
