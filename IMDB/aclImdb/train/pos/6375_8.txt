while i have a great respect for disneys animated films as of late they havent really been what i would call mustsee atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer and thankfully lived up to my expectationsbr br atlantis is a more mature disney film in the sense that it lacks songs a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering the world of atlantis hidden beneath the earths core is fantastic presented as desolate caverns with ruins and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems which while usually containing some reminder of harshness become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached the presentation of simply atlantis landscape and setting without some expendable cheery song gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance the inclusion of an atlantean language as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of reallife ancient civilizations adds to this and works fairly wellbr br also with the exception of some scenes involving moles practical jokes there didnt seem to be much of a childish element that i usually associate with disney films instead the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didnt know about part of this involves the atlantean weaponry which is used in a very actionpacked climax which is for lack of a better word quite excitingbr br granted not all of the story makes full sense and the film doesnt feature any amazing new computergenerated visual effects but aside from the toy story movies this is the most entertaining disney film ive seen in years
