atlantis is a new and right step for a disney feature its a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like atlantis i didnt have any expectations for this film but after watching it i dont quite understand why this film got so bad reviews even in my country the reviewers werent positivebr br atlantis is not a perfect movie but still one of disneys greatest even i doubt that this film ever will get disney classic reputation well thats another case its funny to think that this scifi movie was directed by the same directors as beauty and the beast and hunchback so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation he he im just kiddingbr br well enough nonsense atlantis is a watchable exiting and very enjoyable film even this film its a pgrated actionfeature its also suitable for kids in my opinion parents who mean the opposite dont kill me for writing this he hebr br the story is a little predictable but it doesnt ruin the movie the comic bookinspired animation its suitable for the film and sets a departure from the usual disneystyle its colorful dark and detailed the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive the film is also funny sometimes even i more giggled than laugh through the movie spoilers the characters of this film are also very likable but unfortunately there isnt enough screen time to get to know everybody so some characters are left behind spoilersbr br the score of james newton howard is absolutely great its daring and exotic spoiler the most impressive about this film is how theyre making the atlantean language sound very natural ethnic and authentic its really awesome spoilers overbr br the script is tight and wellwritten but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story but luckily there are not so much of thembr br so do youre self a favor dont listen to the reviewers and watch atlantis cause its waiting for you
