it is written in stone that disney animations simply must be musicals right where show me because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for not containing the hokey madeforfiveyearold standard disney musical fare br br while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been it was still quite good enjoyable and adventurous i had hoped for a bit more yes considering the subject matter but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be br br the animation quality is average but the dialog is quite compelling as is the story line plot subplot and amazing creativity i found within this production i will refrain from outlining the plot as it has been done and done but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasybr br this is in my opinion the best disney animated feature length filmbr br it rates a 9410 frombr br the fiend
