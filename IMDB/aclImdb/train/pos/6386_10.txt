disney the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years films like tarzan and the emperors new groove have made an attempt to move away from the traditional songdriven routine of disneys past and into new uncharted territory atlantis is the boldest step yet but we have to remember this is still disney the first ever serious film to come out of disneys animation studio is a major achievement for them  in fact its so serious it makes it into pg territory perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summerbr br but despite the more mature subject matter this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with not just mature audiences so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of the little mermaid et albr br so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96minute movie ultimately this is an action film about atlantis not about the exposition preceding it so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly youre unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood if you want epic levels of detail in the plot turn to james camerons titanic both films feature a boat in some mannerbr br and lets talk about love shall we yes as with a lot of films the lead male one milo thatch a bumbling archaeologist and lead female kida the clichéd atlantian princess are set to fall in love with each other but what i found was not as clichéd as i was expecting by films end for once the characters touchingfeelingkissing sequence was far more subdued theres various points in the film where the attraction grows but its just not in the ballpark of say the little mermaid a good thingbr br you may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film correct you have your leading hero and heroine backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition all being given their moments during the film numerous other characters appear take up the few minutes of screentime then disappear it doesnt take a genius to do the maths  a 96minute film with a focus on action and visuals and with a considerable cast has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent so what does it rely on clichés and lots of them every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before you have the bumbling scientist the attractive princess the squarejawed colonel the rich eccentric the maniacal sleazebag the russian femme fatale  need i go onbr br i dont know why this got to anyone  i found the tongueincheek nature of this film quite amusing alright this is meant to be a serious flick but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue and sometimes it even is a little inspiredbr br but in the end its those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake the cgi animation is truly amazing in places and doesnt dwarf the characters which was a flaw that let the recent titan ae down speaking of characters disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs bringing an anime style to the film infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime much more so than any previous disney outing this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime nadia for the films overall similarities with said cartoon series having not seen this anime i cant commentbr br with picture there is sound gary rydstrom heads up the sound team and what a soundtrack from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score which compliments the film in every way never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue itbr br perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended to me the film conveys that its an adventure thrill ride albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it if you dont like the clichéd tongueincheek attitude then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight heck at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts coughherculescoughbr br this is a positive 10 out of 10 review from someone who was blown away by this film i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium so sit back enjoy the ride and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film
