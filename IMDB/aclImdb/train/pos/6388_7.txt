heres what i knew about atlantis before watching itbr br   its officially disneys first animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it describedbr br   the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the factbr br   it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it lets rerelease spy kidsbr br so with all that said how is the moviebr br hellacoolbr br im a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that its almost an effects animators bestof show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots a little dull but this isnt a movie you watch for the plotbr br heres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like fivehundredmillion or something i know animators whod kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i dont know what disneys comeback movie will be like but i dont think theyre out of the picture yet
