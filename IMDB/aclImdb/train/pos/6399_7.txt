while it certainly wasnt the best movie ive ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which cant be said for many movies these daysbr br this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sundays character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive
