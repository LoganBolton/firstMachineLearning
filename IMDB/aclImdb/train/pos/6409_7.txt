i hadnt heard about brashear before i watched this this is the story of him and the man who trained him helping him to become the first africanamerican us navy diver a tale of willpower the plot is wellwritten and develops nicely throughout this is what it seems the typical underdog thing and it doesnt hold too many surprises its also quite hollywood but hey i dont know the actual man maybe its close to how it actually happened nevertheless it gets the job done with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way and this is inspirational for anyone whos ever heard the words no you cant be spoken about their lifelong dream the acting performances are all excellent deniro and gooding jr both shine whenever theyre onscreen rapaport is marvelous as well the characters are wellwritten credible and consistent this is welledited and features good cinematography the production values are high and this does a fairly convincing job of transporting us back to the 50s this is the only film ive seen by this director and the writer though i may now consider looking into more theyre responsible for there is a moderate amount of strong language otherwise no offensive material i recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting andor fans of those who made it 710
