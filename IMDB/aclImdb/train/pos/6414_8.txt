i was curious to know how critics responded to this rousing inspiring film so i went to rotten tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nations film critics had given the film an average 43 or rotten ratingbr br all i can say is if this movie doesnt move you you have no heart its interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a 74 rating from viewersbr br not that the opinion of critics is all that important to me after all i cant think of a more useless overpaid profession some schmo gets paid to go to the movies what a tough life and does the same thing everyone else on the planet does forms an opinion but these chumps have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours and even worse they love to hatebr br ill grant you that this movie is old fashioned well except for the fbombs syrupy and a little predictable after all you know right from the beginning that cuba gooding jr portraying reallife navy hero carl brashear is going to triumph eventually at every turn simply by the way he comes across determined and plucky strongwilled and optimisticbr br but his performance and that of de niro as billy sunday a composite character of several reallife people are so strong so inspiring that youll be on your feet cheering many of the films scenes especially the courtroom climax youd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes like our nations film critics michael rappaport is excellent as well as a sweetnatured stuttering diving student that befriends goodings brashear if anyone has seen higher learning this character totally redeems that characterbr br anyway this confirms what ive always felt dont listen to critics see this movie and get inspired
