this film is an excellent military movie it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but  as a retired soldier  i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted the story itself has been told and retold several times over but it remains for a professional soldier  and an african american at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the us navy to the world the story of brashears work to become a navy diver and his life as a navy diver beyond his graduation is not the only story that is presented there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday defied the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one stripe and a change of assignment it also told the true story how brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950s and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself this was a complex story that was worth telling and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible as a professional soldier i was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner
