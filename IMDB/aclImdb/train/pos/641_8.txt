this show has a few clich√©s and a few over the top dawsons creeklike moments a 16yearold talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot  ending with a good lesson in the end i just hope every episode doesnt turn out to be lifealtering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of
