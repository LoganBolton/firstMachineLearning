military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves among the more prominent we have officer and a gentleman top gun gi jane and now men of honor the fact that this one happened to be true doesnt change the fact that the formula is the same this film is probably most like gi jane since it focuses on the desegregation anglebr br the story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best humaninterest story among those mentioned above carl brashear cuba gooding jr is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film unfortunately director george tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than brashear in favor of showing brashear in a constant state of adversity billy sunday robert de niro is a central figure and except for the initial scene the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife we dont know much about him for instance brashear sees the scars on sundays palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow but there is no followup on that point mr pappy hal holbrook gets only one short scene by which we can judge him the rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting if a director is going to make a humaninterest story he needs to humanize the charactersbr br cuba gooding jr gives an outstanding performance as brashear this is probably the best ive seen him this is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before and he rises to the occasion in jerry maguire rod tidwell was a fascinating but onedimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle brashear is much more complex and grounded and the issues he faces are life crises making the part far more challenging this is an excellent recovery from goodings last role in chill factor a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the partbr br after a stint trying his hand as a comedian analyze this the adventures of rocky  bullwinkle meet the parents robert deniro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance deniro isnt a bad comedian he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldnt waste his time doing comedy deniro endows billy sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul it is a pleasure watching him work br br it seems every film i watch lately has charlize theron in it i saw the legend of bagger vance men of honor and the yards right in a row and i was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 actually she only did five this was a minor role for theron but she carried it off well and managed to stay with deniro step for step david keith who costarred with richard gere in officer and a gentleman has a cameo herebr br the dvd has some interesting special features including reflections by the real carl brashear and some deleted scenesbr br i enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the onedimensional presentation i rated it a 710 im a sucker for underdog stories and i have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme this film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the directors shortcomings
