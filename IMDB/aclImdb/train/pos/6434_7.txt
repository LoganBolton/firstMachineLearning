after watching two of his silent shorts elena and her men 1956 is my first featurelength film from french director jean renoir and i quite enjoyed it however i didnt watch the film for renoir but for star ingrid bergman who  at age 41  still radiated unsurpassed beauty elegance and charm throughout the early 1950s following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini bergman temporarily fell out of public favour her next five films directed by her husband were unsuccessful in the united states and i suspect that renoirs latest release did little to enhance bergmans popularity with englishspeaking audiences however she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same years anastasia 1956 she stars as elena sokorowska a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere before promptly abandoning them while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan jean marais she finds herself falling into a love that she wont be able to walk away from this vaguelypolitical film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy as long as you dont take it too seriously its purely lighthearted romantic fluffbr br filmed in vibrant technicolor elena and her men looks terrific as well a flurry of bright colours characters and costumes bergmans polish princess is dreamy and somewhat selfabsorbed not in an unlikable way but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup détat knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a guardian angel perhaps the films only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt mel ferrer then audrey hepburns husband who ignores everybody elses selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love and love alone this renoir proudly suggests is what the true french do best elena and her men also attempts with moderate success to expose the superficiality of upperclass french liaisons through the clumsy philandering of eugène jacques jouanneau who cant make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them for these sequences renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film but the film itself is so relaxed and laidback that the energy just isnt there
