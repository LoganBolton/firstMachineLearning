i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie dont understand how to watch a movie andor have little sense of elegance first to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together modern sensibilities demand great drama no i dont mean great setting of characters and plots but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic this is a subtle movie its beauty lies in its subtlety not to be confused with simplicity neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness politics human weakness venalityyou name it the world its set in would be alien and not understood todaya world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly even if you only think you have itbr br many people today dont understand that victorian society wasnt really victorian as people understand that term todaybr br this movie helps set the record straight
