i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is this film falls into the first category every year i try to see all the nominees for best foreign film at the oscars even those that i know i wont like as it is in heaven seems to fit the bill the plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slowfor my tastes which run more towards original dark andor daring foreign cinema michael haneke francois ozon a lot of modern japanesekorean cinema as it is in heaven does not sound particularly interestingit didnt get released in the usa so i sat down to watch a vcd i found in singapore preparing to cross it off the list after a dull beginning as it is in heaven becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen weak points the characters in the film are pure stock characters the wounded dreamer the town bully the battered wife the loose woman yearning for love the repressed ministerthankfully theyre largely a likable bunch as well as being wellwritten and wellacted ingela olsson as the ministers wife inger would have been nominated for an oscar had her performance been in english strong points the music is beautiful and the main song sung by gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable and keep an eye out for the feisty 87year old actress playing olga who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies i wont discuss the ending but i will say that it makes sense theyre are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film and youre not quite sure why theyre happening although nothing is explained in words it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo  out of  probably the strongest swedish movie ive ever seen
