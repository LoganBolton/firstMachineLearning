this is absolutely one of the best movies ive ever seen it takes me on a a rollercoaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time br br the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentallychallenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriellas s√•ngbr br i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy
