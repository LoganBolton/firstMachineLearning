i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night when i read about kay pollak i was hooked we americans are suckers for a comeback kidbr br i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societiesbr br the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic life is short people and as far as anyone really knows its all weve got it can be taken away at any time so isnt it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because were so afraid of being hurt tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls feeling alive is worth taking the risk give and you will receive so start living nowbr br many people are criticizing this movie for its lack of characterization and other flaws i say you are all pseudosophisticated get a grip folks its a parable a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject povertybr br so join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man writing a check is not enough we are a social species by the way even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possiblebr br rugged individualism has its place but it is overrated
