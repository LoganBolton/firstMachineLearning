kay pollaks 2004 heartwarmer så som i himmelen as it is in heaven contains every stereotype of swedish humanity and inhumanity yet manages to be a crowdpleaser it contains plenty of ammunition for cynical critics continuity errorspotters and for saccharinedebunkers yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community evocatively the film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about finding ones own voice and just doing it despite ones fear without completely removing the lump from the throats of the cynicsbr br its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts firstly small films about strangers bringing new life to rural christian communities provide plenty of scope for the exposure of hypocrisy while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their hairshirts the same year and with a similarly swedish breeze the queen of shebas pearls did it and babettes feast also comes to mind secondly any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individualself focused and impersonalized world this films structural similarity with the likes of the full monty brassed off calendar girls and on a clear day shows its indebtedness to the formula but it is a formula with life left in it yet and this seems to be because people need positive message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselvesbr br the stranger is burnedout maestro daniel daréus on a quest for selfrediscovery the town he visits or rather revisits is unbeknownst to the townsfolk the place of his childhood he was bullied mercilessly by classmates here supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without aspiration to drive a truck here he takes the job of cantorchoirmaster despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders the place is of course populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character arcs can be predicted the brokenhearted fairhaired girl so beautiful she nearly glows the cellphoneringing local businessman the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse the steely pastor and his less austere wife who at first seem right out of ingmar bergman also present jealous uptight spinster siv check geriatric whose soul still sings check elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten check obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say fatty check intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good a checkbr br pollaks film is not all warm fuzzies however it diverts from the lets put on a show despite setbacks and moral opposition subgenre it contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative nirvana the violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and repression but in never delves deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife beater is like this similarly the small town pastor so closely adheres to the moralistic blackwearing superprotestant stereotype that his secret indulgence in girlie magazines is hardly surprising his repressions and hypocrisies are just there dangling unrelated to psychological reality perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy a lost son perhaps glimpsed once over his shoulder holds the secretbr br perhaps these holes are functions of the editing like several inconsistencies and continuity glitches that can be spotted such as sivs unexplained reappearance in the choir twice after moralistic outbursts in fact none of the hitches in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene apart from in some awkward love scenes the films 127 minutes seldom drag but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room floorbr br the film remains solid threestarfare despite the holes that can be picked in it this is simply because in a world of technologyfocused flicks and materialistic selfseeking any glimpse of human community is deep down welcome for anyone even the cynical
