back to the roots with like it is in heaven  what are the real values of life these swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart weve seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat love pure and joy within the music of a choir thats simple yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone br br from the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple warm and rough people of the northbr br he wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved unconditionallybr br dont go see it if youve been normed to hollywood this stuff contains no extras just your laughter your compassion your tears
