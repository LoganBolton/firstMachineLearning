i hate overlong overtalky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid70s and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you havent seen it dont miss your chance
