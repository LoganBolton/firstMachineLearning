this is a pretty ok film yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient and the movie doesnt really justify the large star cast ab sd tanuja however the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon not to be confused with the singer kk in the scene where he first meets amitabhs character i thought that a man who can just look at ab keep staring and not say a word and still look strong is definitely a good actor in fact he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar alongside ab for a second time this guy should get more roles hes brilliantbr br if youve read any of the other reviews here on imdb you already know the plot and i do agree that akshaye khannas entry into pakistan was a little too easy and the little love angle he shared with whatsherface was completely unnecessary but he is a fairly good actor as seen in dch sunjay dutt is cool to watch always and ab what can i say i dont know if im his biggest fan in the world but i know i can definitely compete for the spotbr br an interesting watch considering its bollywood although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like the great escape and bridge on the river kwai
