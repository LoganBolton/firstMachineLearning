its only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama but i can already state that this is one of the best things ive ever seen thats on tv silver screen or even in real lifebr br as a writer its so good its almost demoralising as a viewer its so entertaining that im annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday its clear that all these negatives are actually positivesbr br im a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies tv dramas always seemed to be dated quite tame and well generally boring five days has really brought tv drama into the 21st century so for me at least its mind changing go watch it
