a number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion this is always a problem with long complex dramas crime is essentially banal so the pay off is always anticlimactic whilst detailed exposition detracts from the human drama the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this but has not been entirely successful answers to precisely what happened and why may have been supplied but if so they are well buried the viewer inevitably feels a little cheatedbr br but in a sense this is unimportant the drama was never about the crime or even the investigation it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved the family the investigators the witnesses the press and as such it was gripping the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for primetime drama and the performances uniformly good in an ensemble piece it is invidious to focus on individuals but penelope wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the motherwifedaughter and janet mcteer was in cracking form as a hardbitten old copbr br one of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race as the elephant in the room that noone is prepared to mention subtle powerful stuff
