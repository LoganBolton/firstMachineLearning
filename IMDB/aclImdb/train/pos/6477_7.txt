five days is billed as something special a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes each set on one particular day of a police enquiry but in fact this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories in fact one almost cant help drawing comparisons to the last prime suspect as one of the subplots focuses on a single cynical female cop approaching retirement and its not just the absence of helen mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable theres a lot of earnest overemoting manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic in another suspicious and its possible to guess the guilty party well before the end not because of the internal dynamic of the story but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole certain things must be true to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times in spite of these failings the series grew on me by the end i was quite gripped but its a sad sign that the bbc which once made the likes of the singing detective boasted of this of possibly the best drama of the year for theres little true originality on offer here and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing five days is in fact not rubbish but it is formulaic and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh
