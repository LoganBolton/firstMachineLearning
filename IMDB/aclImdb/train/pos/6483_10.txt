this excellent series narrated by laurence olivier brilliantly it should be said charts the beginning to the end of world war 2 the origins are not entirely examined fully from germanys fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitlers demonic rise but as one reviewer says that must be hard to do in a 26part series with so much to cram in br br apart from the expected combat photographyaction there are plenty of personal emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight especially if youre not necessarily a world war 2 bufffan episodes showing testimonies and what life was like on the home front of the main alliesadversary britain germany japan russia and the usa were quite eyeopening showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians the death camps etc were very well handled and exposed id fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation of which it could be said i am one at 47br br certain things are quite strangely left out like the advent of the new jet era beginning with frank whittles experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteors combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262  especially as the v1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2 this is probably a small oversight not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated br br a series to own as a box set in history terms on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud
