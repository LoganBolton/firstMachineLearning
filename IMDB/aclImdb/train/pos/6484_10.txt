i remember watching this in the 1970s  then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public librarybr br with a nearly 30 year hiatus i have come to another conclusion most of the principals interviewed in this series  some at the center of power like traudl junge hitlers secretarykarl doenitz head of germanys navy anthony eden uk  are long gone but their first hand accounts will live onfrom generals and admirals to sergeants russian civilians concentration camp survivors all are on record here br br i can remember the lord mountbatten interview killed in the 1970s br br this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work  well deservedbr br seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the setbr br this is the only 10 i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine it is more appreciated with a little time
