war is hell but this documentary of wwii is heavenbr br not only is this series a breathtaking almostexhaustive look at the second world war its a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivierbr br this documentary series defines the genre its sweepingly long no doubt but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a yearbr br truly this is an impeccable bit of filmmaking other than olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supperbr br im going to go watch it right now again my 11th time
