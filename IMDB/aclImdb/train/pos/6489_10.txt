i watched this series when it first came out in the 70si was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didnt want to watch itit became a weekly ritual every sunday and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something specialbr br the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to documentso the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to eachsome episodes covered long periods such as wolf pack which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlanticwhile the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itselfbr br this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are deadthe list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the timeanthony eden the foreign secretarycarl donnitzhead of the uboatsalbert speerpet architect confident and later armament minister for hitlerin one of the later episodes we see traudl junge hitlers secretarywho was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testamentshe left the bunker after hitlers suicide and escaped through the russian linesthese and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayedbr br if i have any criticism of the series it is that the codebreakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makersbr br the opening titles and music are magnificentand lawrence oliviers narration lends a natural gravity to the scriptbr br the best documentary series ever made without doubtunmissable
