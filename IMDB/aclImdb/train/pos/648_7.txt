i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you dont have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nightsbr br now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you dont mind here goes br br alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alexs affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end its revealed veronika is pregnant with alexs child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilbertes situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope br br with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebruns character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed br br not a bad effort 710
