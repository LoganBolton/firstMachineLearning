i am not a very good writer so ill keep this short world at war is the best wwii documentary that ive seen ive seen different wwii documentaries not only englishnorth american and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that ive seen i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and whyhow hitler got to power but it does a very good job at covering the war it seems to be complete and objectivefair to everyone it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations it has a lot of original footage including color footage and many eye witnesses it was made in 70s when a lot more were alive it has great music and narrator allinall i gave this one 1010 because its that good i havent seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those
