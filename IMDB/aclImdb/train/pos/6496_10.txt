example of how a world war 2 documentary should be madeusing first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflictand archived footage gathered from around the time i caught this on a rerun on the history channel about a year and a half backwith no knowledge really of the second world war at the timebut it enveloped meand now i consider myself a world war 2 buffwatching and reading any and all that i can find about itbut nothing comes close to this landmark documentarydefinitely worth buying the boxed set ofbr br this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard
