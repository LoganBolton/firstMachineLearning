i must have seen this a dozen times over the years i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b  w on the local pbs stationbr br i bought a dvd set for the children to see and am making them watch it they dont teach history in school and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century it expands their critical thinkingbr br impartially with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why it details what lead up to the war and the actual warbr br buy it for your children along with alistair cookes america watch it with them and make them understand youll be so glad you did
