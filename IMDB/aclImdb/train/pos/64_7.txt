this is paul f ryans first and only fulllength feature he hasnt done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i dont know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home roombr br busy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van zandt victor garber is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shootingbr br lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal james pickens jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesnt seem to care shes isolated so the principal punishes her she needs to visit deanna every day until five o clock then the movie startsbr br i cant even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable theyre growing up and trying to deal with things they havent experienced theyre doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high schoolbr br the director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them many people deanna answers although some days later we learn theyre from her parents who come every week the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in deannas room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely toobr br the ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing its something i wasnt waiting for it eliminates some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction a damn fine moviebr br when it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and thats a pity she hasnt made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasnt got many opportunities for other rolesbr br the same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script im waiting for his next movie im hoping the best for all of them
