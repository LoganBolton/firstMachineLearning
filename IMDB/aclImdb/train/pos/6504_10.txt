my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times i cant imagine how it could be better this isnt the complete history of wwiino library could hold such a historybut it is the best summary of that history lots of detail lots of personal stories and still keeps the overall picture in viewbr br oliviers narration is excellently written and of course superbly given the interviews are from all sides except the russian because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd we treasure our copybr br the producers do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles for instance but still the episode on this subject is very well done
