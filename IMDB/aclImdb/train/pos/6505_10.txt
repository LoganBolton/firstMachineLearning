theo robertson has commented that waw didnt adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitlers rise and wwiibr br perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8 covers this period and together with the earlier volumes in the series shows clearly the existing conditions i feel a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period joined the hitler youth even and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in wawbr br this documentary is so far above the history channels documentaries i also own that there is no comparisonbr br the only fault and it is a small one that i have with waw is this the numbers are not included many times for instance if youre talking about lendlease then how much war material was lentleased how much to russia how much to britian how many merchant ships did the uboats sink and when how many ships did the german or japanese navy have total in 1941 what type were they how many troops how many troops did the allies have in total and by country lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off but i would have preferred more and naturally i always want to see more military analysis like why didnt patton  clark trap the german army that was at cassini after they had it surrounded instead of racing monty to rome and letting it escape i dont think you can begin to understand war until youve seen some of these video segments on total war like the fire bombing of dresden its like trying to understand auschwitz etc before you see the clips of the death camps you just cant wrap your head around it  its too unbelievablebr br unknown at that time and of course unfilmed were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese including cannibalism read flyboys and some live vivisection of medical experimentation prisoners wo any anesthetic br br dave
