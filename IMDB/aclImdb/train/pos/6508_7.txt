i grew up watching scooby and have been a fan forever this cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers the crooks in mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that its not meant to replace the scooby gang its just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers im sure the cartoons focus is on scooby and shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time if you are a fan of scoobydoo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog along with the jokes that come with it just enjoythe cartoon and support the creatorswriters and producers so that this wont be the last scooby cartoon
