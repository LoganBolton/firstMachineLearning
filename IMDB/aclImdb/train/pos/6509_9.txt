i just cant believe some of the comments on this show the show is just genius sure it doesnt follow the tried and true but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again shouldnt we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while the style is not as realistic as previous scooby doo shows but its not supposed to be the show it titled shaggy and scooby doo get a clue what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action and nowhere does it say that theyd be solving mysteries and they cant even stand monsters so why would they im actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scoobydoo show they still have running jokes clumsy hijinks quickchange outfits in chase scenes the standard hallway gag and even scooby snacks in fact im glad that this show is out there because i just love it im even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villainbr br sure its ridiculous its supposed to be sure its different its supposed to be its supposed to make you laugh at the villain and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin no matter what the size youre supposed to get the running roobiroo joke the whole thing is just put together so well there isnt a single thing i can think that is wrong with it the writing the acting the animation all top notch the title music is awesome my computer plays get a clue when it boots up and the background music is just gripping
