a great movie rather challenging than really entertaining sadly no memorable quotes here but this ones my favorite alexandre if youre leaving someone that you have loved you have to say what im telling you now farewell im going but to disappear to hide like a criminal is ignoble didnt watch it with english subtitlesbr br in my opinion this expresses it all there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth however knowing the truth can hurt even more as alexandre experiences common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of liberated love by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved it does indeed show this in a convincing manner but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth its not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure but people especially men i think should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated lovebr br that said the movies realistic though and really worthwhile watching
