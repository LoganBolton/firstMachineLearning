i actually really like what ive seen of this cartoon so far sure the animation isnt the best but frankly id rather see this type of more cartoony style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply which was starting to happen more and more oftenits only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it theres nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little blackdot eyesin fact i think its really cute as a kid i never thought scoobydoos design was particularly adorable but i think i might like it better knowbr br anyway shaggy has always been my favorite character and believe it or not but i think he has the most potential for some depth sure the show doesnt center around the original mysterysolving theme but that was just a tired old formula anyway dont get me wrongim sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to mystery incs traditional pursuits which has been lacking as late but in the mean time this show is a fun deviation from the standard shaggy and scooby are still funny but no longer only comic relief theyre still cowardly but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be shock intelligence theyre the same old overeating slackers as ever but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of uncle alberts inheritancebr br i used to find most original scoobydoo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best but this show actually exercises a capacity for real humor also i never really like casey kasem as shaggy anyway so the new actor doesnt annoy me as much as he does other people i still think billy west was the best thoughbr br overall while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history still an achievement among other scooby incarnations
