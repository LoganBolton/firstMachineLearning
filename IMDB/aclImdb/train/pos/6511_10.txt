like many here i grew up with scoobydoo unlike many here who did i love this show i think that it has been very well done and thought through everything about it marks it as a spinoff which isnt meant to be taken seriously the formula is simple  it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy by using the well known shaggy and scoobydoo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episodebr br there have always been scoobydoo spinoffs which have annoyed fans the classic being the scoobyshaggyscrappy shorts from the 80s these spinoffs had their place they allowed new content to be sold created new fans and kept scoobydoo merchandise on the shelves i would agree that shaggy  scoobydoo get a clue doesnt fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scoobyshaggyscrappy shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the bestfunniest scoobydoo characters good features of the show the animation the voices the attention to detail the badguys the best friend relationship between shaggy and scoobydoo the constant humour bad features none although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at timesbr br well done warner bros animation one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time
