to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didnt go into theatersthe deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when usedthere are a few dull moments when the storys following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday gets the props it shouldthe very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writerthe property he buys turns out to be where the witchtooth fairylives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger dont wanna give anything really away just a little info if youve wanted to see this movie then do so its worth the price of the rental
