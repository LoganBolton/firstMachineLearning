i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the makeup was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out
