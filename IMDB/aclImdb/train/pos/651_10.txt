 possible spoilers br br i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better like veronica says two chicks at one time it brings out the horniness in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than hookers teasing us every step of the way i get into the conversations too even if they are utterly bs at times so what every chick just about that ive ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous selfcentered bs philosophy its just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other bs philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women hes into the same bs and moodiness the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person therebr br i think its kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica shed love to pull the little blonde away from alexander but veronica plays her all the way shes brilliant she gets the brunette thinking theres something up between them and then she steals the boychildman which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group the brunette knows shes been had by the end when shes dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this refrainbr br but do they get married in the end alex and veronica mmmm i can only imagine a supertumultuous relationship ending in a premarriage breakup they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stonesbr br i like the film though it kept me entertained its got a nice look and its sexy
