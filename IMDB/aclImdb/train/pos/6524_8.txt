br br if youre at all interested in pirates pirate movies new orleansearly 19th century american history or yul brynner see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it dont be put off by various lacklustre reviews my reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted for the most part has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte while not all the events in the film are historically accurate can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans history and the lovehate relationship between the respectable citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the citys favorite sons dont worry about what the film doesnt do but watch it for what it does do ie for its study of one of new orleans and americas most intriguing historical figures
