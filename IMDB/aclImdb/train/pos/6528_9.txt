i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival in a small 200seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festivalbr br i absolutely was into it i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes it is amazing setdesign the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930iesbr br and the music is so nicebr br i rate this experience 910br br  spoilers ahead br br the documentary tells about awesome bluesmen with blackandwhite oldlooking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing it is really amazing but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary it is the too abundant use of links to modern rockbands playing those blues songs in a modern way i didnt really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs this is the same kind of unperfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social clubbr br the documentary was such a standingovation at this first screening in the little cinema that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the openair cinema though the sand the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night
