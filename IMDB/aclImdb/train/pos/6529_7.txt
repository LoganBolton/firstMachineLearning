i was forced to see this because a i have an 11 yearold girl and b we had shown her the bonita granville nacy drew movies from the 1930s which she thoroughly enjoyed personally i didnt think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks but on the other hand it wasnt the nauseating piece of intelligenceinsulting fluff i feared it would be it was an inoffensive mildly entertaining movie although im pleased that they didnt try to upgrade nancy to 21st century hipness veronica mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew i do think that they made her a little too bland that they didnt do enough to develop nancy drew  the movie could have been titled jane doe girl detective i have to blame the script i think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with i liked emma roberts in this role but they gave her a madefortv not theatrical release script
