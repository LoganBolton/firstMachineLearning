i really liked this movieit was cute i enjoyed it but if you didnt that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she isnt quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls didnt have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes blindfolded at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely wasnt just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it
