if my expectations werent exceeded they were certainly met nancy drew works both as a mystery and a comedy it pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time the movie starts with a closeup on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books it then begins lampooning the books immediately writerdirector andrew fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous so he doesnt treat the idea religiously he pokes fun at nancy drews ability to do anything such as ace every class in school know which baked treat is perfect for converting any enemy to her side make a bird house with twelve flying buttresses and even perform an emergency tracheotomy at a party nancyd always be in perfect style if she were living in the wholesome 1950s instead of present day la and she carries around a sleuth kit complete with fingerprinting dust flashlight compass and magnifying glass preposterous of course but i seem to remember the hardy boys access at any given moment to csi equipment being a little too convenient as well and if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart its just more comedic exaggeration on the movies partbr br the mystery of the movie is handled more seriously nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to los angeles where nancy digs into a cold case involving the murder of a hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago nancy searches for clues in some pretty practical ways such as surfing websites like google and this one and watching old videotapes of the victims movies when she does something more out of the ordinary you have to admire the girls resourcefulness emma roberts an undeniably cute kid plays the pintsized amateur sleuth beautifully she makes the tooperfect girl completely lovable if not completely realistic tate donovan is also great as the tooperfect girls father carson drew hes an ideal father figure without being unrealistically perfect and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger less likable is max thierots take on ned nickerson nancys boyfriend i much preferred george ohanlon jrs portrayal in the 1970s tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew in which ned was a gawky awkward kid with a little crush on nancy the character of corky josh flitty a twelveyear old with a crush on nancy is much less annoying than max thierots ned amy bruckner and kay panabaker seem appropriately cast as nancys gal pals bess and george but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the filmbr br speaking of cameos chris kattan snl eddie jemison oceans 13 and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in nextbr br the movie does fail to live up to some potential its mentioned early on that the drews new house is heavily boobytrapped but nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that also nancy describes the cold case shes about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party which should yield plenty of potential murderers but she only encounter a handful of suspects and while theres some moments of real suspense during nancys adventures the solution to the case comes out of nowhere and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and whocareswhodoneit ralph salls score adds to the movies suspense but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame still i really enjoyed this film and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls people of any age and gender can enjoy it
