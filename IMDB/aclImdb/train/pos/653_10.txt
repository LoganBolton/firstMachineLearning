la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time and whats most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by prousts a la recherche du temps perdubr br indeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story  the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly the first womans name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte  veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one veronika takes the place of gilberte in alexandres life and in the movie she progressively eclipses her first by time to time gilbertes still coming when alexandre waits for veronikathen totally that shows its the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly  and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusionsbr br art is what causes the passage between whats outside  the illusion of love  to whats inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie its made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art br br this conception of art comes from proust with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political  see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says  art doesnt care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence first of all art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected  art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes  i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie thats why la maman et la putain doesnt hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text  the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustachebr br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a livingdead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if hes writing his lifeyou can guess that hes not that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurses room alexandre looks more like albertine than marcelbr br to explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a balzacs reader in forme et signification jean rousset explains that in prousts the readers of balzac who are swann and charlus are unable of any artistic creation because theyre stuck in reality which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art and thats exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bressons for example hes like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticellis womanbr br life is perhaps not my vocation this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if its said by alexandre nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache  if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fearsbr br by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions its death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jeanpierre léaud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sartes huitclot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouvé if eustache had read proust alexandre could never have finish the book  always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafés la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander doesnt become an artist whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer genettebr br if like baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain
