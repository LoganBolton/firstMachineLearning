as a grownup in my mid40s i am not even close to any of nancy drews key demographics but i was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon so i could tell were the pair of sixtyish silverhaired ladies down the row from me the older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20ish female usher who said shed seen the film the previous evening and quite liked itbr br more to the point however in the row just ahead of me there were nine  count them nine  tenyearold girls lined up next to each other passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previewsbr br once the film began they promptly settled down to watchbr br and didnt so much as peep till the closing credits began to rollbr br this is not a perfect film it doesnt quite pay off its high school subplots its not quite confident enough of its own tone and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times but the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful the plot hangs together fairly well and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization last but not least emma roberts carries the movie with startling grace  josh flitters superb timing notwithstanding this is roberts movie and she pulls it off beautifully her nancy drew is very much the direct ancestor of kristen bells veronica mars and the film is also a lineal descendant of jodie fosters early and underrated candleshoebr br in todays marketplace its a rarity a family movie that respects its viewers intelligence as such it wont be to everyones taste  but for what it is it is the best movie of its kind in decades
