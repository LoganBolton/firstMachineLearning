although well past the target audience ive always had a soft spot for ya fiction so i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the screenbr br this is not a bad film the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously so young audience members will not be upsetbr br what i really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experiencebr br emma roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully well see her again in another mystery
