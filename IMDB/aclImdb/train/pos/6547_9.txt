i took my 10yearold daughter to see nancy drew over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained first off it was clean and i mean by my standards the majority of kids movies today are full of crude toilet humor and grossout jokes to elicit cheap laughter from the preteen crowd nancy drew is smarter than that however and the humor is subtle and cleverbr br the title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by emma roberts who is perky and polite without ever becoming annoying unlike the brady bunch movie where the anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculed nancys style is treated with respect and dignity its a great moment when the la styleconscious girls with their paris hilton streetwalker attire are dismissed by the boutique owner while nancy in her penny loafers and homemade butterick pattern dress is embraced this movie shuns the weneedtoenlightenthiswholesomegirl tack so many hollywood movies take nancy remains true to herself and her values throughoutbr br the mystery is just tense enough at times to be engaging there were several suspenseful moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm but there were no gratuitous shock scenes its all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun the supporting cast is good particularly marshall bell as the creepy caretaker there are some great cameos by eddie jemison chris kattan and bruce willis and many moments that will make adults smilebr br this film deserves better ratings than some have given it not only was i glad not to be dragged to yet another computer animated film where talking animals burp and pass gas all over the place but i was also very entertained had i been there without a child i still wouldve enjoyed the movie this is one dvd that will have my daughters name on it under the christmas tree
