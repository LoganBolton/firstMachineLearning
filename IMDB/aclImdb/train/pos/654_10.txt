in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution purposefully i use quotations for that word jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who cant seem to get enough love if there is a message to this film and id hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this benhur length feature has to offer its that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth is it possible to have two lovers some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want br br what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre jeanpierre leaud has with the women around him hes a twentysomething pseudointellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie bernadette lafont slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible loveofhislife left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika fran√ßoise lebrun who perhaps reminds him of her soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but were mistaken the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inbr br were told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was i cant say having not been alive in the period to see it firsthand was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions but eustaches point if not entirely message is that its practically impossible to have it both ways you cant have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with fing as the characters refer over and over again br br the mother and the whores strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk youve ever seen in a movie at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether its about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself isnt pretentious though it could appear to be but that its about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when theyre ultimately alone in the morning br br if you thought films like before sunrisesunset were talky relationship flicks you havent met this but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or deep or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional its never ever uninteresting or boring on the contrary for those who cant get enough of a good talky film its exceptional while his style doesnt call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustaches newwave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on thembr br this is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we cant ever perceive them as faking an emotion or going at all into melodrama its almost too good in naturalisticrealism terms but for eustaches material there is no other way around it luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika a claim she staggeringly refutes in the films climax of sorts in one unbroken shot and as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late parisianbr br sad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge not available on us dvd and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid ive seen from the country in general its complex its sweet its cold its absorbing and its very long perhaps too long its also satisfying on the kind of level that id compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each films release
