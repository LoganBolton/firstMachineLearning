look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it im not ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasnt like the book im sorry  in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however im sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar  the book was better when i watched to kill a mockingbird the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasnt like the book im not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars  if anything itll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards im saying give film a break its film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable  featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the hebrew hammer and supporting roles featuring tate donovan jimmy cooper on the oc and rachel leigh cook shes all that this is the first time ive seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of erics her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and againbr br i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release
