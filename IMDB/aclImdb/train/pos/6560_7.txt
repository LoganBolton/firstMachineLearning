i think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western filmsbr br this is not a bad movie  it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns i dont believe this film was taking itself seriously for a momentbr br what makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong beautiful women two of which are black one asian and a mexicanhispanic characterbr br these arent your usual western womentheyre toughthey can draw fast and shoot straightbr br theyre so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskeybr br the plot which moves this story along is typical of westernsin the vein of you shot my brotherso im gonna get you only in this western a womans sister has been shot and shes out for vengeance on the gang who did itbr br so she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing daysbr br one of them maria is not really all that interested in avenging rachels sister but she is motived by the fact theres gold and jewelry hidden in the town where theyre headedbr br there are a couple of scenes that dont quite make sense not that they interfere that much they can be ignored but i wondered why they were there so the film could use a little tightening but over all this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it isbr br my only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villainof the heroines one is obviously straight the others sexual orientations are never disclosedbr br 7 stars
