jake speed is a film that lacks one thing  a charismatic lead unfortunately thats something that really taints the entire movie and its a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting if derivative premise although its genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy  the film actually plays a little more like romancing the stone albeit in reverse its not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character who happens to chronicle his own adventures leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventuresbr br when a young woman goes missing in paris her sister margaret played by the appealing karin kopins gets embroiled with pulp hero jake speed wayne crawford and his sidekick dennis dennis christopher who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the clutches of two brothers the deliciously evil sid john hurt and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice roy london thats the plot  its not labyrinthine and its not complicated but the story that it tells doesnt require great depthbr br the action sequences are appealing to begin with and its certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their paces whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions and there are certainly some quite funny lines however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome this however may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne crawfords performance it becomes harder to really care what happens now i dont know if he was stretching himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether hes simply not a good actor as i havent seen him in much else but he never really convinces as a roguish mixture of doc savage indiana jones and jack coltonbr br this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well  karen kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake unfortunately it never convinces dennis christopher is perfect as the archetypal sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp relish  almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman he strides about his few scenes growling in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film sid is no moriarty he is presented as jakes nemesis from a number of his previous adventures  books but he is always fun to watchbr br jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as night of the comet a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand and almost succeeds but misses  which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television seriesbr br i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good
