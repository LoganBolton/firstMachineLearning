most people 36 gave this movie a 10 and those who dont are being too critical or maybe expected something else this is one of my favorite movies from the 80s it grows on you and has it all i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint having plenty of action drama romance and even comedy add to that the great car chases automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun edge of your seat experience you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this br br you can watch this movie with your wifegf and you will both enjoy it lots the premise is that of a paperback book hero like doc savage really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here the actor jake speed is also a director producer and writer of many films in this film jake speed the character is an indiana jones adventurer type he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower yayand sheer dumb luck too keep an eye out for his one james bond hitech equipment the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the skybr br the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie once bitten and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sisterbr br the bad guys are real bad men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel sadly never made  but you can just imagine what would happen nextbr br you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and thats worth the price of a ticket
