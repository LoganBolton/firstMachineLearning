jake speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message it has its flaws of course at times its a little slow it introduces its villain too far into the story its action is paced at the rate of a snails heartbeat it has a zgrade cast although ive always admired the work of karen kopins who has the straightlaced good looks of sandra bullockbr br but with all this going against it jake speed really is inspiring thanks to a charming script by wayne crawfordwho plays the title role and andrew lanebr br why do i find it so inspiring because it says to me hey why not try to be a good personbr br the story is essentially a stranger in a strange land premise that is goodandheroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people jake is more than a boy scout hes more than a knight in shining armor jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty mean and evil worldbr br its because of this that jake speed really needed to be a hit it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the worldbr br imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people im not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex but that it would be nice if more movies such as jake speed would get a chance due south a tv show about a canadian mountie is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainmentbr br sure jake speed has violence blood and guns but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person youll beat the forces of evil every time 101499
