of all the reviews ive read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i dont think so though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandres position in an urban area can ask for im looking for a patron anyone interested
