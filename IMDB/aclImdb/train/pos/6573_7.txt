the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start  i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial but still its carried out fairly well and the story  especially the dialogue are interesting theyve taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play perhaps its a good introduction to shaws playsbr br the main character raina has her head in the clouds  and a flair for the dramatic and helena bonham carters acting does a good job here her fianc√© serges is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure her parents are entertaining enough
