with few exceptions most of george bernard shaws plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days too arch too talky appears to be the general verdict this bbc version of one of shaws funniest plays doesnt refute that verdict it is certainly arch and talky but it is also wonderful and because of the quality of british theater it is perfectly cast with actors whom  with the exception of helena bonham carter  most of us have probably never heard of carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional chocolate soldier pip torrens and later falls in love with him one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius patrick ryecart the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemys lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns however the role invites overacting and ryecart was obviously told to overact the other players are letter perfect carter as the selfdramatizing bulgarian aristocrat and torrens as the swiss soldieroffortune are at the plays center of course and they are wonderful yes arms and the man comes across as a filmed play but youre unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesnt betray its origin the plots are generally clever however shaw is all about the dialog the action is minimal even in st joan and the sets are immaterial enjoy this for what it is
