la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post68 and eternal in many respects true the actors dont act  true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by françoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case and imho jean pierre léaud is one of the greatest french actors
