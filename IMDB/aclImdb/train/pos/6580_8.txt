do not judge this production by the 2hour version that was released on vhs in the us which is a choppy and incomprehensible mess i had the pleasure of watching the fulllength 6hour version available on dvd from the uk and was spellbound the deliberate pace and growing sense of menace are mesmerizing as is the amazing visual and aural landscape this is an ancient rome we have never seen before and far more authentic than mostbr br director franco rossi was justly celebrated for his 1968 miniseries of the odyssey and this miniseries is equally powerful just as bekim fehmiu became the screens best ulysses so klaus maria brandauer may be the screens best nero now i am hoping someday to see rossis version of the aeneid eneide that was broadcast on italian tv in 1971br br i am undecided which version of quo vadis is more powerful this one or the polish miniseries from 2001 each has different virtues and in many ways they complement one another certainly either one towers over that hollywood campriot starring peter ustinov
