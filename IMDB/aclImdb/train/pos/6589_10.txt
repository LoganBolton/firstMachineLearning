i loved this show from its first airing and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week the plot characters writing special affects were outstanding then the scifi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining well written show i say bring it back i know all of the actors would come back i would suggest buying the dvds i am i hope the scifi channels executives get word of these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers i only watch one show on that channel now ghost hunters but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too
