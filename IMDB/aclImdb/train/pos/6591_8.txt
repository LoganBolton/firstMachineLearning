the invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love it reminds me of the old school 80s seriesateamairwolfknightrider the special effects are small but very effective but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series it really shows the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want especially paul ben victor and vincent ventresca ventresca really shines in this one for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesnt get a shot in a big movie mr tarantino this was the show you should have directed instead of that major boring grave dangercsi get this show if you can well worth it
