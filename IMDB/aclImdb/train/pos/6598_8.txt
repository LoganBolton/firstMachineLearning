ive seen this movie when i was traveling in brazil i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences to see this movie in sao paulo itself was a revelation it shows something of the everyday life of many brazilians on the other side it is sometimes a little bit overdramatized and thats the only negative comment i have on this film its sometimes too much too much sex too many murders and too much cynicism for one film the director could film some things a bit more subtle it would make the film more effectivebr br despite this i liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself the characters are complex and very much like reallife people not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time that makes the film realistic even when the story is not that convincing
