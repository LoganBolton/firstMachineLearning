this film is absolutely stunning a new blade runner  future noir at its most gritty the vision of paris is superb both recognisable and visionary with sweeping vistas grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual realitybr br the story line is quite simple with few surprises but thats not what i like most about the film it is a visual treat br br done in 3d and rendered in black and white no greys with only one short spot of colour it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds there are many arty camera shots  closeups and odd viewpoints  but that just adds to the temperament of the film overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage formbr br i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped such was the level of animation and high detail in the characters facial expressions but unlike a scanner darkly  which suffers from or indeed is enhanced by inconsistent character definition just watch the way some of the hair changes shape  renaissance is consistent and precise throughout when the character is in closeup added details and texture can bee seen but when in midshot or further away details are omitted but not to the detriment of character definitionbr br for me the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a oneoff project such a shame as i would like to see more of this futuristic filmnoir storyline and especially in this cuttingedge graphic stylebr br oh and the english dub is great toobr br all in all a great film and highly recommended
