renaissance 2006 was created over a period of six years cofunded by france luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around 14 million the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comicbook style animation aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with sin city 2005 but this film employed motion capture with liveactors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format presented in stark blackandwhite the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us directed by french filmmaker christian volckman in his featurelength debut renaissance draws significantly from other films in the sciencefiction genre and the technoir storyline isnt something we havent seen before but from a technical standpoint it is faultlessbr br the year is 2054 the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings the citys largest corporation avalon achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth and the companys research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process ilona tasuiev voiced by romola garai in the englishlanguage version which i watched  a brilliant young scientist is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work and so it falls to legendary detective barthélémy karas daniel craig to uncover her current whereabouts possibly holding the key to the womans disappearance is bislane catherine mccormack ilonas hardened elder sister whose trustworthiness is in question and jonas muller ian holm the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughterbr br the eerie dimlylit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scotts blade runner 1982 and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in minority report 2002 which was coincidentally also set in the year 2054 however despite this familiarity volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit blending classic filmnoir and sciencefiction the result is an eyecatching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows which i should warn occasionally becomes difficult on the viewers eyes the dialogue is a little banal at times and the story though engaging doesnt offer anything strikingly original except for the ending which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula but renaissance is intended to work best as a visual treat and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied
