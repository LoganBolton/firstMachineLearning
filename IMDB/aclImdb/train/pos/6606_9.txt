time for hollywood to sit up and take notice if the actors are acting snooty all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings although the voice overs by the cast craig mccormack pryce etc are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the cartoons are unnervingbr br this style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting ironically such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie the pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crispbr br plot disappearance of a mega corporations top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a cold hearted hero at the helm cant say much without giving it all awayexcept that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat the climax leaves you speechlessbr br a must watcheven for the grownups who smirk at cartoons
