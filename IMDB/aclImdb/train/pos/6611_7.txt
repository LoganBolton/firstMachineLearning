every second of the film is gorgeous and thats why it earns a 7 because the plot is not especially devious and thinking back over the last 90 minutes i never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters if anything the luxurious graphics and framing have made certain scenes the car chase for instance more pedestrian than they ought to be  not that they dont look lovely and have some very original design and occasionally novel camera angles  but they are missing the kinetic movement and closeup shots that are part of the language for any normal actionthriller the first hour plods along and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey  people wait for each other to finish and dont always react in a natural cadence which would be a problem of recording each individuals dialogue separately on rare occasions the emotions in the voices dont quite match those on screen something that should really have been avoided the futuristic architecture is very attractive lots of glass wallsceilingsscreens lovely smokemiragespecial effects and nicelooking cars but again  its more an exercise in graphic design having no real impact on the story id argue that the whole point of using drawn animation instead of actorscgi is to really push the limits of imagination and design to do that which is too difficultimpractical in other mediums although the animation in renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly wellaccomplished i never felt like i was seeing something that hasnt been done beforebr br immortel another french cgi film also suffers from an imbalance of beauty over story  pace to be fair some marvellous and engaging french movies also have a languid pace and lingering shots of the look in someones eyes or the rain on paris cobbles can evoke great emotion  but animators need to understand that while animation brings unique strengths it also has weaknesses when compared to reallife technique perhaps it would break from the noir rules that the film wants to stick to but i think the filmmakers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more  the social strata the fascistic grip of the corporations etcbr br i have no problem recommending renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design andor animation manga fans in particular but i wouldnt make my other filmloving friends sit through it take away the sumptuous visuals and its a barely average film
