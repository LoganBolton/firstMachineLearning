a very unique scifi animated film and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be better or worse this french film is quite interesting to watch the technique part is innovatory like waking life i recently watchedbr br it took me quite a long time to get used to the blackwhite style but eventually i love it the sketchlike images are really fancy the contracted future world is a symbol of human races final destination which i adore it very muchbr br the whole plot is fine for a scifi not so intriguing but its ok like some hollywoods products a giant conspiracy about humans eternity a little bit clich√© and the twisted ending is not so convincing some development is just too plain and insipid and the whole movie is too longbr br so i think im just in love with the style this film shows others are not so goodbr br about the eternity of life i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we dont want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking but thats also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills ones life and make the world colorful and lively
