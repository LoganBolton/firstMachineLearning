i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters renaissancebr br and firstly that it looks as it ought to look a boys adventure renaissance is the tale of a cops investigation in search of a missing young scientistilona tasuiev the geneticist and researcher for the avalon companybr br the tale of karas ilona and bislane is though much less known than sin city the better movie and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful i have enriched my french comics collection last week though im not so uptodate the atmosphere the music the characters their lines the plot are all nice and endearing a parisian top cop karas is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medicalgenetic research ilona tasuieva mildly hot blonde whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable i guessbr br for me an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series renaissance a marvelously beautiful cartoon was like a replay of a wild wild west episodehere a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological futuremore jaded and blasé but in a sense as thrilling renaissance is not suspenseful nor does it look especially wellpaced but its seducing and hypnotic moreover it achieves sketching albeit briefly a world a true worldand we will think about the avalon nakata jonas mueller the tasuiev sisters and goran farfella and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah  i liked renaissances feel of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness and also the professional assured look among these new cartoons this one and linklaters dick adaptation the only and first dick adaptation ever stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitementbr br i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and when not conventional vividly eerie like the invisibility costumesbr br as advisable the characters have exotic names like bislane and farfella mostly gathered from the arts and entertainments world goran and ilona and naghib br br none seems to have noticed that renaissances poster features a rourke lookalikethat guy is marv which doesnt make it a sin city ripoff but not a paragon of originality either and in fact theres more resemblance to the miller talenamely the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society the brio of the hero in fact a cross of willis character and rourkes persona in the previous movie on the other hand this cartoon breathes a more public air a brim of straight adventurousness and in a word its like sin city for kidswell naughtier kids i mean cause theres a bit of nudity on display to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic even as clichés and common places of the futuristic more adult comics look true enough and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there now its also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn so to each sin city its renaissance i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales a rather undemanding specialty
