animation always seems to be fringe in japan this might not be the case but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat kids tag on it france is probably one of the more comicliberal countries home of classics as tintin asterix lucky luke valereon and so onif youve never read these its not too late theres no upperage limit on them and they dont carry the nerdstigma of dc or marvel it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france it suits my prejudiced image of the french as artloving antiusaoriented and talented moviemakers luckily theres also a scanner darkly out there to suppress that view  seems art is pretty much internationalbr br anyway as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french if youre a normal person you will get scared by this theres no need for that however beneath its cool sleek celshaded appearance theres a good thriller and a good movie overallbr br that was one of my fears for this movie its so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick much like sony  co are doing with their pixar ripoffs i was expecting a confusing sometimes boring and not very engaging movie but luckily i was wrongbr br i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neonoir stuff but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well note ive seen the french dub which was ok as far as i could see english might be more interesting what with craig and everythingbr br a final word of praise to the animation it was awesome futuristic wellcrafted nice camerawork smart solutionseyes for example looked very good which is hard to do and so visually stunning i felt like bursting out this is so damn impressive then again i really like animation and i appreciate the effort the studio put down so my verdict is a bit biasedbr br good movie anyway definitely lives beyond its gimmick
