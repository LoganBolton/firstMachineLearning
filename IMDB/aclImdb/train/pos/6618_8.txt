picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyperstylized black and white visuals of frank millers sin city then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as steven spielbergs minority report or richard linklaters a scanner darkly an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckmans bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although volckmans work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance volckmans end result justice  the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than thatbr br genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neonoir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian scifi drama which serve to compliment each others storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation  the films title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling workbr br volckmans film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the films highlight  superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous br br the films english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman karas and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sisters disappearance he is investigating despite a wavering english accent romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous megacorporation avalon ian holms reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenesbr br all together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms for fans of either of the films intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watchbr br 810
