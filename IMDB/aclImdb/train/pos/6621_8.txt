i just came back from a prerelease viewing of this excellent scifi film noire its style is definitively unique and very well made it is filmed with actual actors but transformed into a black and white comicstrip style you have never seen before it goes one step further than sin city and it does it well its a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures the story and mood remind of blade runner and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too the storyline is intelligent never boring and has some nice little twists this film is a mustsee for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely dont like scifi or bw
