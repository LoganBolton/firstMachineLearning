first things first this movie is achingly beautiful a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lightercompositor the visuals blew me away every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story well its okay its not going to set the world on fire but if you like your futuristic blade runneresquire tales and who doesnt then you will be finebr br i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole i saw it at the cinema in english but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewherebr br definitely worth seeing
