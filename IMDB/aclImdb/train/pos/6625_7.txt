if youve ever seen the trailer for the film the recruit with colin farrell and al pacino youll never have to see that film sadly renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makersbr br the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher the setting is a futuristic paris and science fiction elements feature throughout the special thing about renaissance though is its visual style and not its story renaissance is 3d computer animation like final fantasy but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts the result looks stunning although the problems of 3d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome slightly robotic movements slightly wooden facial acting etc as a highly stylised beautiful film noir renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience especially visually the story and writing though are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals its not a bad story and presumably if you havent seen the trailer its a lot more exciting than it was for me but it is a story that isnt highly original and verges on the corny a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny making the writing sound like a beginners first effortsbr br i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends its unlike anything ive seen before visually and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience it is also a watchable story even if it isnt perfect
