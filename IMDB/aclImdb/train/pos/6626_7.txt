one reason pixar has endured so well and been so successful is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics they have a story to match their style and often very moving style at that affecting charming and crossgenerational that a lot anime speaking in broad terms and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is i think and i might be wrong partly because either the makers arent bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous so enervating that they dont have the energy to create a really engaging storybr br that same cannot be said of renaissance there are flaws in its plot but ill get to that later those same flaws however are not reflected in the visuals  renaissance is nowt short of stunning the ultrahigh contrast images sometimes so highcontrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible and incredible detail are always impressive always a joy to behold the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world dark murky quite affluent and even clean but shrouded in intrigue corporate malfeasance obsessed with beauty capital of the catwalk after all and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental sophisticated architecturebr br its a compelling environment not entirely original but great all the same the films muchtouted motioncapture technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a blackandwhite photographer would die for not that the detail prevents entertainment because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences a hellforleather care chase a couple of gruesomely imaginative murders several tussles in the dark and a nasty dustup in a gloomy apartment the locations are great too i want to visit the nightclub while the central character of karas is your regular offtheshelf maverick cop the other two female characters who are sisters are the real motors of the movie coming from wartorn eastern europe products of a war diaspora and a family spat theyre a compelling metaphor for europe as a wholebr br the film is tremendously atmospheric its dizzying swooping fauxcamera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience however the plot it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev a dropdead gorgeous and pioneering scientist after shes snatched from the street the sinister corporation avalon is any corporation ever not sinister which she was working for on classified projects are hellbent on her retrieval and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands dead bodies cigarettesmoke and narrowlymissed bullets and falling in love with ilonas sister bislane very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack as he plumbs the depths of the citys sordid underbelly and his own pastbr br textbook noir in other words but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city to which it bears a passing visual resemblance the plot and resolution are dull the theme of immortality being raised but never examined and the shenanigans of highrolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull  undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension the basic ideas are familiar scifi genre materials and theres a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane materialbr br however the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry but its the projection of life in paris circa 2054 the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold i may be taking it too seriously and if thats the case i can at least say that its superbly made extremely entertaining and pretty mature too and with an ambiance like no other
