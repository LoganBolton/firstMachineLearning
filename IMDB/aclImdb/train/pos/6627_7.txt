a scanner darkly minority report blade runner sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking outbr br french animation project renaissance took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in stockholm my spontaneous reaction is awe my further reflection is huh neat and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding meh it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent as do the flat characters br br nevertheless it is clear that the people at onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface the visuals are staggering they have used live action motion capture fitted into keyframe animation with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background for those of you who are not down with the technical lingo the film looks like a fullyanimated sin city its fluid transparent dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning its a vision yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons suspenseful music heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking its every technerds wet dreambr br the film zooms in on an eerilylit bleak futurescape paris in which a major corporation called avalon has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance think the fluid transparent screens from minority report and genetic engineering the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher ilona voiced by the lovely romola garai cut to our hardboiled coponsuspension and protagonist karas daniel craig  a man who takes the law into his own hands  who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving ilona during this case he is being aided by illonas sister with whom he also begins a love affair a very halfassed love affair if i may say sobr br the world of renaissance is remarkable director christian volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads rats femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelledout archetypes in the story or the film would have been too surreal for mainstream audiences owing to its lurid animation format it follows then that we have a multitude of clichéd characters such as evillaughing villains sleazy crime bosses and butch toughchicks who blow smoke every chance they get it shoves noir in our faces and it isnt necessarybr br what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction daniel craig helps here too by bringing a nononsense attitude to his hardedged cop character at one point in renaissance he is seen in a vivid carchase that surely is one of the most adrenalinepumping and top notch sequences of the film unfortunately the novelty of the scifi visuals have worn off post this car chase and renassaince could benefit from being slightly shorter in summary a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experiencebr br 7 out of 10
