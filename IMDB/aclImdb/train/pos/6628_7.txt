ive seen this film in avantpremiere at imagina festival in monacobr br i saw the first trailer four years ago and from this moment i was waiting to see the final result i havent been disappointedbr br it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render clearly inspired by some comic books such as the ones from f miller in this optic it goes one step further than the excellent sin city adaptation from r rodriguez this time almost no grey or any middle color but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated filmcant wait for scanner darklybr br the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements such as direction or plot the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium and that is a really good surprisebr br the futuristic story paris 2053 makes it a classic scifiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end despite a classic base plot an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectationsthe atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes genetics absolute power of certain firmsgives this movie a great interestbr br despite it is an animated film this one is obviously not made for children you wont find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral only the cold reality it is far closer to a good film noirbr br i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film we still feel the well known paris but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurismbr br nevertheless i regret a few mistakes the montage is sometimes a bit flat one or two very clich√© slow motion effects and some poor dialogs even though the technical is excellent it shows its limits in some romantic sequences a bit like final fantasy did those little things makes it a 710br br altogether it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can the director christian volckman knows how not to fall into potential traps luckyly they didnt ask john woo to do the jobbr br to conclude it is a film with blasting visuals an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction watch it if you canbr br please excuse me for the spelling mistakes
