i have no idea how to describe this movie and also would love to provide others the same opportunity i had  seeing it with no prior knowledge of what to expect i enjoyed it immensely but can also say i barely understood what was going on if in fact there was anything to understand in the first place fans of david lynch tangentially or especially guy maddin films should particularly enjoy this and any fans of the comic book eightball will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder it came as close as any film ive seen to the tone and mood dan clowes creates so effectivelybr br one slight note just to warn anyone easily offended  this movie if rated would be nc17 for sure fans of male fullfrontal nudity howeverhmm wellyes this is weird wild stuff
