story says that on that on december 28 1895 a small group of thirtythree people was gathered at pariss salon indien du grand café to witness the cinématographe a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named august and louis lumière the small audience reunited that day some by invitation most due to curiosity didnt really know what to expect from the show and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen most thought that the cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slideshow projections until the photograph started to move what those thirtythree people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that daybr br of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day la sortie des usines lumière literally exiting the lumière factory was the very first to be screened the film shows the many workers of the lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work while a very basic actuality film movie depicting a real event the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise as their concept of moving pictures was limited to edisons peep show machines the kinetoscope the brothers invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe as the people and the horses moved across the screen the idea wasnt entirely new le prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionarybr br la sortie des usines lumière would become the first in the long series of actuality films that the lumière would produce over the years this primitive form of documentary was the brothers favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the cinématographe could have despite the initial lack of enthusiasm after the first showing the cinématographe became a great success and la sortie des usines lumière quickly became an iconic image of that first screening it definitely wasnt the first movie the brothers shot that year and it probably wasnt the best of the 10 movies shown that day personally i think that l arroseur arrosé was the best of the 10 however it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates as literally this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it 810
