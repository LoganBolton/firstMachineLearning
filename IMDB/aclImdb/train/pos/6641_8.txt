on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand café in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience la sortie des usines lumière was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audiencebr br we start with closed doors of the lumière factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close againbr br whether this is the first film or not some say larrivée dun train à la ciotat was the first film lumière recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you dont get to see historical things like this every day
