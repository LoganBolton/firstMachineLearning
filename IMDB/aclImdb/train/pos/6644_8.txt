after too many years of waiting anne rivers siddons noted 1979 book the house next door has finally been filmed the result veers a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as its a tv film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of stephen kings favorites and one of mine as wellbr br with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the richness inherent in the original threepart story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured especially the climactic revelation near the very endbr br still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its nextdoor amateurartist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvasbr br be sure to read the great novel
