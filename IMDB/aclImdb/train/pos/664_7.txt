tales from the crypt and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth mary ellen trainor kills her husband joseph marshall bell she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac larry drake dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum  has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas  tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantagebr br this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 directed by the one of the shows regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic the vault of horror  was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt 1972 which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor this particular version is good enough but doesnt do anything different or special  is a bit too linear  predictable to be considered a classic at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace the story is just about macabre enough  it generally provides decent entertainment  i quite liked the downbeat ending this time there are christmas themed opening  closing crypt keeper john kassir segments complete with the usual punsbr br director zemeckis does a good job  theres a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well theres not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someones face is cut with an icicle someones arm is cut with an axe  theres some blood splatter but generally speaking its not that graphic the acting by a small cast is pretty goodbr br and all through the house isnt the best tale from the crypt but its a decent one all the same worth a watch but after the comic book story  original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this
