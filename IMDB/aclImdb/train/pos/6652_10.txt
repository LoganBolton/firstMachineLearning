i saw the movie and really could not stop my tears its tragedy that india has no such leaders after freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they dont behave properly in current generation politicians bring their childrens into politics without measuring their caliber and skills i remember the dialogue from gandhi what kind of society we want to createmake with such people about harilal no wonder that it will be a dream that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation einstein was right when he said about gandhi that after 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body soul and mind mahatma gandhi had ever lived on this earth i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor feroze khan and all film actorsactresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son all father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles
