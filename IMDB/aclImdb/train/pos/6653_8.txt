keeping all political views aside feroz khan and anil kapoors gandhi my father is a good movie that cleverly explores the confusedtowardsfamily side of mohandas karamchand gandhi and the fight of his eldest son harilal gandhi with the society his largerthanlife father and most importantly demons in his head one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their fatherbr br the acting is good shefali shetty darshan zariwala and akshaye khannastrictly in that order add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the fingerbr br feroz khans direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive however the screenplay couldve been tighter i had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type dvd it was called mahatama vs gandhi i think and it was certainly more gripping though the movies background score and the fatherson and motherson moments are just a brilliant treatbr br this movie could have been great its borderline to that it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both somewhere the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions nothing comes to youbr br it compares decently to other gandhis certainly not an overview film like kingsleys gandhior abstract as kamal hassans hey ram the film just about manages to find its footing however one is left wondering what if worth a watch 7510
