feroz abbas khans gandhi my father a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi for a story thats as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell its a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school now the film aims to convey one very interesting point  the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father this point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england which gandhi twice denies his son instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head the director just moves along with the story thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal it comes off looking like hes overreacting br br the point im trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did we never really understand why he turned to islam and then back again to hinduism the thing is we never really understand harilal at all and thats because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle a story most of us are already familiar with to put it simply gandhi my father promises to examine the strained fatherson relationship but it doesnt so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhis son but show us why that was a burden to begin with show us incidents of their early conflict for example its not enough that gandhi merely says hes opposed to harilals early marriage tell us why this opposition its not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out  for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate words are not enough show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhiwhats more instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship the film goes off on too many tangents thus diluting the impact of the central theme this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence and yet on many occasions thats exactly what it seems like because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment even though much of it has no relevance to the films basic premise  the stormy fatherson relationship so you see the problem with this film is not that its a bad film but its certainly a very confused film what happens to harilals children after his wifes death does he ever have relationship with them where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba none of these questions are answered in a film thats basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself gandhi my father is a disappointment no questions askedcinematically it struggles to translate the filmmakers ambitious intention to the screen practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fadeins and fadeouts never quite seamlessly leading into each other on the positive side there is inherent nobility in the film which you recognise the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative trying hard not to take sides never once judging either father or son painting neither as the villain what the film does do however is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation but evidently alienated his family of all the actors in the film its only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luckdeprived harilal gandhi its a wonderful performance and its not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wifes dead and youll realise how much he conveys through body language alone darshan jariwala meanwhile who plays gandhi senior adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years but its the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actors best contribution to that role the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba the woman whos meant to be torn in this fatherson conflict but if shes unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then its really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script much efforts gone into the making of this film and thats evident throughout but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what youll remember about it when you leave the cinema  its just so boringdirector feroz abbas khans gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy and with this film the director makes us too
