i just dont understand why this movie is getting beatup in here jeez it is mindless it isnt polished and it is as i am reading wasted on some the cast of this movie plays their characters to the t if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed these are misunderstood wellintentioned misfits trying to save the cityworld with nothing but grit and determination the problem is they dont realize their limits until the big showdown and thats the point this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel i just dont get it the jokes work on more then one level if you didnt get it i know what level youre at
