i cant say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers yes its bogged down by an overlypadded running time hamfisted editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch br br on the other hand its also got some laughoutloud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise macy stiller and azaria are brilliant as the core team and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team i cant say reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine br br the plot as i said above is your classic underdogmakesgood stuff no surprises there since you know theyre going to triumph what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd gaudy heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding look at azarias relationship with his longsuffering mother macys endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap amazings secret identity stillers rage not unlike that one weird spazzy kid you once knew whod always go into quivering impotent rages on the playground garofalos desire to avenge her father this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics and underneath its parodic exterior mystery men shows us why these hackneyed comicbook tropes matter to so manybr br it never really gels into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of halfbaked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that the fact that its supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so ill issue a caveat if youre the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical am i to believe this is some sort of snort magic xylophone then you are far too literalminded and humorless for this film go rent a sandler film insteadbr br 710
