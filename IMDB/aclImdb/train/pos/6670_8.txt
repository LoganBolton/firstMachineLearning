there are many problems with mystery men first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities the special effects detract from the story and are not really that special paul reubens is wasted in a pathetic juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accentbr br now onto the decent parts william h macy three heavenly words and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect the sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs ben stiller is very amusing as well showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes all of the characters do and that is an area which i found particuarly ironic that is because all of the actors are indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of hollywoodbr br to be honest the reason i thought it failed at the boxoffice is that america doesnt get ironybr br all in all i loved the film but i feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary cgi landscapes and effects
