a lot of the user comments i have seen on the imdb for this movie dont really do it justice first of all let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously its supposed to be a fun yet stupid movie that doesnt require one to think only to enjoy it if you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour then you will be sorely disappointed yet if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actorsactresses and some good catchphrases then you will enjoy it
