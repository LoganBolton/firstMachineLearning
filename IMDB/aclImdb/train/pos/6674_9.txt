the first thing i thought after watching mystery men was how could this movie be so unpopular i found this movie so adorable and funny that its status as a bomb defies logic well i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung its fansbr br simply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the princess bride did for fairy tales and who framed roger rabbit did for classic cartoons that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to this is one of those cases like the iron giant where the studio had no clue what it had on its hands rent it the next time youre in the mood for something a little offbeat you wont listen to the beegees in the same light ever again
