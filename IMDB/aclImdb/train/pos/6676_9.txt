warning may contain spoilersbr br so who are these mystery men simply put the mystery men are a group of subheroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities the shoveller bill macy works construction during the day and at night leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovelfighting style the blue raja hank azaria sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night if his mom isnt keeping him busy with the latest snooping mr furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay then takes out his frustration on his friends at night tossing illconceived oneliners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry leaving everyone to wonder so what ben stiller breathes such life into this character you cant help but love himbr br these three spend their nights trying to capture that moment of glory theyve dreamed about becoming real super heroes obviously it could happen champion city has captain amazing after all a flying fighting supercop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middleaged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his careerbr br to bring back that extra magic that might win the endorsements again ca frees casanova frankenstein a waaaaay overthetop menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush this lunatic genius has created a psychofrakulator to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities and ends up capturing ca within hours of his release from prison this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankensteins evil plan but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein the trio are going to need a little helpbr br recruiting commences and after a painful recruitment party the team settles in with the bowler janeane garofolo who initially has the only real talent in the team with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father the invisible boy kel mitchell who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him the spleen paul reubens granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy and the much underused sphinx wes studi who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting overwisebr br this film really is a crossgenre romp anyone wanting to pigeonhole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle this is a spoofparody of the superhero genre  from the pseudoburton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comicbook genre gets a pretty good sendup but at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well both at once while not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of dc comics shortlived inferior five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen it offers the comicbook world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wannabes  and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city youd see a halfdozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis sure the shoveller fights pretty well and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy  all parts of the superhero world but does that make them genuine superheroes only in their mindsbr br this movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of superheroics oneliners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ballfather yet it isnt a comedy in the sense of sidesplitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes it mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of itbr br what really makes mystery men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging the weaklame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become superheroes justice is served and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise if the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great rompbr br of course no movie is perfect claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr furious love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone and the villians are never more than guntoting lackeys a point of which is made in the film the cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very wellbr br yet overall this film is incredible you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but its a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain restbr br 810 in my opinion
