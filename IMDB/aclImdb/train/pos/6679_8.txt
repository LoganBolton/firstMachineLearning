i make just one apology for this film there are far far too many wide angle closeups and if they irritate you beyond endurance fair enough they drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so but after that i made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography and long before the end of the film i had ceased to care this is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily its hilarious its witty the comic delivery of all of the cast is flawless and however much usher peers at his characters through a cold fisheye lens  he may not care for them much  he manages to present them with warmth mystery men is in fact not only funnier not only more clever but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being the jokes in the austin powers movies for instance as well as being less funny than the jokes here are also much more toothless the satire of mystery men bites when theres something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isnt it doesnt mock just any old thing which is why contrary to what some i must regard them as unobservant critics have said it never runs out of ideasbr br the super heroes are an attractive bunch sure theyre secondrate but theyre not merely second rate the blue rajah for instance does nothing but throw cutlery at people and he isnt that good at it on the other hand neither is he comically bad hes better in his limited field than most people and he does practise diligently hes not a buffoon which makes him a much funnier character than if he was if superman is christ in a cape the mystery men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of mount olympus in capes much funnier also much more endearing
