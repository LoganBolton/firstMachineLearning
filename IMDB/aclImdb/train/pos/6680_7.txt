this was different thats for sure just look at the cast talk about oddballsbr br william h macy and ben stiller were the stars although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superherowannabees the most outrageous was played by paul reubens of pee wee herman famebr br there is lots of humor garish colors and no lulls its a pretty entertaining lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters all of whom want to be heroes a la superman batman spiderman you name they have talents in strange areas however that the real heroes dont and dont want to its silly but you know that going onbr br its also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity its a long movie for one so hectic so taking a break here and there is okay the language was tame so kids could enjoy this too in fact i dont recall any swearing in here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering what a dumb fing movie i thought it was fun two hours but id rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks
