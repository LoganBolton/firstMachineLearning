this is a great movie i love it more each time i watch most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again  as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo or hank azaria says goodbye to louise lasser or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens  is a pleasure this is pitch perfect ensemble acting the story develops directly and consistently the action sequences are creative and not too dominant all the setups payoff by the end seriously if youve seen it and its been a while watch it again and if you havent then get started you cant watch it again until youve seen it the first time wes studi william h macy the tryouts scene too much good stuff
