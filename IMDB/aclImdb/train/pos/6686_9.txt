this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong  there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it  you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor  despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
