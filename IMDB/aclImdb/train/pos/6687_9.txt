though i cant claim to be a comic book fanatic i have read my share so i guess im part of the audience of this film and i wasnt disappointed it does run out of steam near the end its almost overflowing with ideas and it seems like lena olin one of my favorite actresses was left on the cutting room floor also a little of hank azarias blue raja can go a long way still its easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun all the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles especially william h macy as the straightarrow shoveler and janeane garofalo as the bowler and unlike some i found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier i also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys somehow it seemed appropriate
