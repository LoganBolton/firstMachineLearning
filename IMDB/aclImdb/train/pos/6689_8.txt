as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasnt been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasnt disappointedbr br mystery men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fartpowered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happybr br though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among usbr br i definitely recommend this movie although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if youre worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way youll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while
