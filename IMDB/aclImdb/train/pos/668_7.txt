i just watched the last wave in my schools fine arts library its intriguing like all peter weirs stuff but its not always as attentionholding as i would have liked i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me because they are very well handled by the films director weirbut at the same time i was not stimulated enough by them aka i got a little bored in spotsbr br the plot surrounds an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an aborigone group he is defendingbr br it starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout most notably the bizarre belching sound designand strong direction but it just didnt entertain me like weirs later films do i might just need to watch it again thoughbr br good film about obsession and mystery because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequencesbr br god bless peter weir though for him alone this film is worth watching  very organic director like an aussie response malick id give it a 7 because its got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments
