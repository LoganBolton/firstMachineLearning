i saw mystery men on my birthday in 1999 while i was away on vacation when i came back home i went to see it again keep in mind i was twelve but at that time it was the coolest movie ever i even collected the ultrarare action figures i have them all except for the bowler which is the hardest to find they made mr furious the shoveler the blue raja the spleen and captain amazing in case your wondering there is a william h macy action figure in existence ive watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine due mostly to fond childhood memories its not a perfect movie but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult followingbr br the story a bunch of lowlevel superheroes save the day this was executed again in the mediocre directtovideo the specials as well but this is the other end of the spectrum big budget huge budget almost 100 million i think studio comedy yes the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot but dont think this as a stupid special effectsy superhero movieits a parody they fight a villain named cassanova frankenstein people he has a psychofrakulator whatever that is its a doomsday device hell take over the world yada yada and resident superhero captain amazing a zapp branniganesque greg kinnear with commercialproductlogos on his costume nice touch is kidnapped time for the mystery men mr furious ben stiller gets mad the shoveller william h macy beats people with shovels the blue raja hank azaria british throws forks the bowler janeane garafolo bowls invisible boy kel mitchell guess what he does the spleen the great paul reubens farts and the sphinx wes studi cuts guns in half with his mind i am not kidding the rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes geoffrey rush as cassanova lena olin heavily edited out as cassanovas bride and the one and only tom waits as a crazy weapons dealer sowith macy kinnear olin and rush there are four oscarnominees and one winner and tom freakin waits its not perfect though its overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there the shovellers full of thembr br the dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy which is sometimes lacking theres a guy who farts for his power case closed the dialogue is definitely a highlight the cyclical ramblings of the sphinx the mixed metaphors of mr furious etc its downright a funny movie it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let all star by smashmouth out into the world br br unfortunately the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have a sequel was originally planned the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from the flaming carrot comics the flaming carrot was planned for the sequel i believe but this did not do well at the box office it could have been a hard sell a superhero comedy with the guy from theres something about mary it also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as the sixth sensewhich ended up being the biggest hit for the month of augustas well as the thomas crown affair two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend oddly enoughdick and the iron giant critics gave mm passable reviews but it was quickly forgotten sadly enough on comedy centrals roast of jerry stiller comedian jeffrey ross commented to ben stiller that i saw mystery men and i fired my agent ben is then seen to mouth the words i should have to dont listen to him give mystery men a chance
