when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows melissa joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show salem the cat he was immensely funny the first few season in my opinion were the best where sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life they were most funniest most entertaining and most um good im not a fan of when they started introducing brad and dreamer cause i quite liked valerie but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season if youre gonna have new people at least keep them i didnt like josh he was a twt i preferred harvey but then he disappeared and they got rid of libby it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years and mr craft as well if him and zelda got married that would have been gold then sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into roxiemilesmorgans house i didnt like theses people either it didnt really seem they liked sabrina sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into theyre own stupid story lines i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old reruns were back and i was like whoohoo lol i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terriblethey got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt and now shes working at some magazine shop so theyre putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show if theyre in every episode it kind of ruins it the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster i saw the last episode it had the aunts in it zelda was reduced to a candle and shes about to get married but she runs off with harvey the end i would have liked to know what happened after well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed its appealing self through the seven years was salem the cat
