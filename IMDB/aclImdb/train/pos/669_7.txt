you know the people in the movie are in for it when kingsized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but hes too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreamsbr br darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from directorwriter peter weir already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock 1975 here its the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white mans court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him and then therere those scary dreams that come and go at odd timesbr br well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlains wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all its the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesnt really register the revelation br br of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocuspocus but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells yet its also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps theres something about past and future to think about herebr br anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
