my kids recently started watching the reruns of this show  both the early episodes on the n and the later ones on abc family  and they love it i wasnt aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season im curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes  ive seen them described as highly publicized and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes personally i dont see a whole lot of difference  the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout  but they do lose some great people along the way my daughter has put the dvds on her wish list so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this i also wish theyd done some selfreferential humor about the changes  like on boy meets world where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so and when a different actor later shows up playing her they ask her where shes been and she says upstairs or when early series token geek minkus shows up for the high school graduation they ask him where hes been and he says over there pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera before saying hey mr turner wait up and running off screen mr turner being another character who left oh well  maybe there will be an e true hollywood story on this or something i was just glad to see aunt hilda show up for the finale  she was always one of my favorites  its too bad it couldnt have been a more encompassing cast reunion the zelda candle just didnt cut it for me
