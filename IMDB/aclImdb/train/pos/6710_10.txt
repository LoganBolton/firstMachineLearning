sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite tv shows of life d i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school so far i think ive watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times melissa joan hart plays the perfect teenage girlwitch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to shes funny smart outgoing witty and a lot more caroline rhea and beth broderick both fit the part very well as sabrinas aunts zelda the intelligent scientist and hilda the crazy wacky one make a perfect balance in sabrinas life though i must agree that the college years arent as good as her high school years but that doesnt mean they werent still good i think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped it made sense and i loved it anyways
