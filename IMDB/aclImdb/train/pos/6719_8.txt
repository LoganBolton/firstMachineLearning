i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies it is filled with supersurfer greg nolls home movies and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50year passion nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory it is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic surfers are not astronauts nor testpilots nor are they surgeonsperhaps or phdsagain perhaps it believes in the quest of the surfer it believes in the beauty of human goofiness it believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before it celebrates the downtime of a country which fought a cold warinstead of a hotwar  with the russian socialists surfing is the ultimate narcissism it is dangerous but only slightly historical i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received this movie has no military heroes it has no guns the only beachhead surfers conquer has a beerstand and and a surfboard shop this is not a problem peace is not desperate it is the joy of exhalation
