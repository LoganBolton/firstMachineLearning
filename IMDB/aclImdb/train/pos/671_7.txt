i remember seeing this when it was released in a theater in palo alto and not expecting much i mean  an australian movie but it finally got to me heres a scene richard chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in sidney facing an australian aborigine elder named charliebr br chamberlain you were outside my house last night you frightened my wife who are you and charlie at a deliberate pace replies who are you who are you who are you who are you who are you    are you a fish are you a snake are you a man     who are you who are you who are you its a stunning scene shot all in close ups with chamberlains blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to charlies black broadnosed bearded visagebr br the two guys couldnt be more different and this film is the story of how chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable almost unspeakable mysteries of charlies worldbr br i dont think ill go on much about the plot its kind of an apocalyptic tale but i must say whoever did the research on australian aboriginal belief systems should get an a plus theyve got everything in here from pointing the bone to the dream time a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real its an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects charlys world simply begins to intrude into chamberlains dreams for reasons never made entirely clearbr br if theres a problem with the script thats it nothing is ever made entirely clear does chamberlain who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines die in the last wave do the aborigines does the entirety of sidney the basic premise is a little hard to accept too though granted that this is a fantasy the aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans bestow on american indians whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying  more elegant and beautiful if you like  mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence the mysticism of charlie is more convincing that the miracles of moses in cecil b demilles the ten commandments but theyre brothers under the skinbr br but i dont care about that taken as a film this one is pretty good and its especially important for marking the celebrity of the director peter weir and the australian film industry this was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes some of them raucous like mad max and some subtle and dramatic like lantana i like weirs stuff which resembles nicholas roegs in being pregnant with subliminal dread try picnic at hanging rock for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood
