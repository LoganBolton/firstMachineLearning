i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasisbr br in my teens i lived a block from the wedge one of the hardestbreaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world ive been out in 15to18 foot surf and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding mavericks by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surfdiveswim by yourself he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i wouldnt go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left br br in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are uncontrolledbowelevacuation waves when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40to60 foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon im blown away there is a dedication and focus in bigwave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world br br this a great film i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great bigwave riders in the world outside the hamiltonkalama crew and i think they deserved mention splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is
