if you have seen dogtown and zboys or have any interest in seeing the real noncaricature real american side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything youve seen beforebr br this film is unreal a facile term if ever there was one but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it  it is a 100 factual documentary but with all the drama of an opera and the completely apparent sense of love expert and knowing instilled by stacy peraltas direction and narration this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeingbr br this film is a symphony crafted as well as beethovens 9th beginning beautifully with its prelude in hawaii tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats again in hawaiibr br like classical music like beethovens 9th ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings this may be the only piece you like but its worth it trust me
