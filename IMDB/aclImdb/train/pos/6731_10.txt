i rate this 10 out of 10 whybr br  it offers insight into something i barely understand  the surfers surf because its all they want to do nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing nor is it a temporary thing  its a lifetime for these guys  buried in the movie is a great history of surfing i have never surfed but i love surfing movies and have seen many none taught me what this movie did  the movie was very well edited it flowed well the interviews were outstanding  its interesting from start to finishbr br in summary its about as good as a documentary as i have seen so i have to rate in terms of that so 1010
