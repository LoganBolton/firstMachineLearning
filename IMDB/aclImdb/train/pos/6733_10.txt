theres been a spate of recent surfing movies that i seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was the focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s greg noll to our current laird hamilton from waimea bay to mavericks to jaws hell i could watch a movie just about laird hamilton  one of this generations great athletes  so the rest is just gravy theres loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars in pleasant relaxed and unpretentious fashion of all the surfing movies ive seen this tells the bigwave story the best and i think its my favorite enjoy
