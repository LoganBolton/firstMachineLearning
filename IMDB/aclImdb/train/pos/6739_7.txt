film noir is an overused expression when it comes to describing films every crime drama seems to be a noir but where the sidewalk ends really is a good example of what the genre is all aboutbr br very briefly an overzealous detective andrews accidentally kills a nogoodnik who works for the mobsters the killing is blamed on the father tom tully of a woman andrews meets and falls for tierney to save dad from old sparky andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself inbr br the morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail but that doesnt excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the nogoodnik in self defense he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates hes already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career then at just the wrong moment the phone rings its andrews partner and andrews tells him the suspect theyre trailing isnt at home he hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the riverbr br what motivates a guy to do something so dumb okay his job was at risk but now hes committed multiple felonies at least i think they must be multiple i counted obstruction of justice assault disposing of a body without a permit littering firstdegree mopery and bearing false witness against his neighborbr br in the end we dont know whether to root for andrews or not the suspect didnt deserve to die true but it was after all an accident because andrews didnt know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head maybe its that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was among other things such as characteristic lighting if noir involved nothing more than blackandwhite photography murder criminals mystery and suspicious women then wed have to include all the charlie chan movies under that rubricbr br andrews is pretty good hes a kind of mark macpherson from laura gone bitter he never laughs and rarely smiles even when seated across a restaurant table from gene tierney a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men he has no sense of humor at all his few wisecracks are putdowns when he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says careful i almost hit my head andrews riposte is thats okay the cabs insured andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well his underplaying is perfect for the part little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states and i guess the director otto preminger stopped him from pronouncing bullet as boolet and police as poelice never could make up my mind about gene tierney she does alright in the role of tom tullys daughter a model but shes like marilyn monroe in that you cant separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits did tierney actually have such an innocent almost saintly persona when she answered the phone at home did her voice have the same singalong quality that it has on screen poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder and andrews too nice guy though he appears to have been slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcementsbr br the dvd commentary by peter muller is unpretentious informed and sometimes amusingbr br anyway this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir the good guys arent all good although the bad guys are all bad maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie for the kiddies only one shot is fired on screen and nobodys head explodes sorry
