a turkish bath sequence in a film noir located in new york in the 50s that must be a hint at something  something that curiously in all the previous comments no one has pointed out  but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie br br the turkish baths sequence a back street at night the entrance of a sleazy sauna and scalise wrapped in a sheet getting his thighs massaged steve the masseur is of the young rough boxer  beefcake type  and another guy a bodyguard finishes dressing up dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away we know he has a reputation for roughing up suspects good cop but getting out of control easy why is it that he hates them so much  br br could it be that he hates himself this part of himself he inherited from his father  that dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk into the gutter  what if that dark side lurked within a closet  remember  whenever dixon meets scalise  3 times the guy is lying on a bed and he only has men around him for company  the irony of the  girls poster pinned up on the wall near his bed br br scalise acts funny affected manners cranking his neck arrogantly defiant shoving his inhalator  poppers  into his nostrils each time he talks to dixon dixon with a vengeance is bent on pinning down scalise who seems not to understand  i never saw a man so full of hate as you i consider it almost humorous the way you came after me alone  four years jumping at me as if i was somebody special why br br because scalise is someone special indeed  he is the direct inheritor of dixons father   your father liked me your father set me up in business he stands as dixons criminal brother his dark side incarnate and to top it all he prefers the company of men dixon knows it well  who killed him paine you or one of your playmates playmates  notice how each time they meet dixon manhandles scalise he picks the addressbook out of his jacket slaps his face punches him scalise  i warn you not to touch me   dixons homophobia is obvious or put it different  his unexpressed homosexuality  dixon aka dixons kid is the son of a thief in reaction to this he decided to become a cop a good one but there is something of the criminal in him a dark side he is a violent copper a murderer a liar besides he is not married brings a dizzy blonde to his familiar eatout place every now and then but nothing else the waitress scoffing says that he doesnt know how to make love to a woman dixon has a deep feeling of guilt and hates himself for those reasons a hood and a mobster like his old man blood will tell finally in order to achieve redemption dixon decides to sacrifice himself  if he gets his alter ego scalise to kill him he will free himself from the guilt and free the girl and her father toobr br the end of the movie brings us back to the opening sequence  scalise is pushed in the gutter and dixon deserves the right to walk the sidewalk and wins the love of the dame he is straight at lastbr br the unspoken theme of the movie could very well be that of a man who in order to cover his repressed feelings wants to experience a womans love  jean douchetbr br these notes owe a lot to the film commentary by jean douchet in the french dvd edited by carlottai
