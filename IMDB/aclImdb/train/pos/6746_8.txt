this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story that is handled exceptionally wellthanks to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performances dana andrews stars as a hotheaded detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains soon after the film begins andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues hell be off the force a bit later while investigating a crime hes attacked by a suspect and andrews is forced to fight to protect himself this time he does not use excessive force but the assailant is killed andrews panics and assumes they wont believe him so he tries to cover up the deaththough instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crimebr br theres a lot more to the film than thisincluding a plot involving a slimy villain gary merrill and a love interest for andrews gene tierney all in all this is one of the better examples of the genrewith great gritty dialog superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story this is the way noir was meant to be
