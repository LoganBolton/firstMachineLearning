where the sidewalk ends 1950 opens appropriately with dana andrews and gene tierneys names inscribed on the sidewalk as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate the sidewalk represents respectability integrity and morality  only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter but even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion and when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting ones shoes wet mark dixon dana andrews was born in the gutter his father a professional criminal and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb as a police detective dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked but he possesses a meanstreak that he cant escape when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised a cheap criminal wholl cheat and lie to cover up his offencebr br where the sidewalk ends was the only film to reunite dana andrews gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb laura 1944 though the two films as far as noir goes couldnt be further apart whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a countryhouse murder tale this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama given her ravishingly memorable performance as laura hunt its unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused occupying the typical niche of the pretty helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in jules dassins the night and the city 1950 andrews on the other hand has rarely been better exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that i hadnt expected of him gary merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss scalise but he doesnt seem mean enough for the role and i think that an actor like richard conte who played mr brown in the big combo 1955 would have better suited the character i hadnt realised this but conte appeared just one year earlier in premingers whirlpool 1949br br the tension as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime is absolutely riveting  certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era  though i feel that the situation still wasnt exploited to its full potential the taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified dixon as the perpetrator but preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs had the witness been brought in as dixon was reenacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance we could have had some genuine fireworks and why for that matter couldnt the taxi drivers testimony have immediately absolved jiggs taylor tom tully from suspicion of murder niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben hecht who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hardhitting cops and wisecracking felons andrews seething and implosive lawenforcer tormented by rage and remorse has rarely been done better at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas rays on dangerous ground 1952
