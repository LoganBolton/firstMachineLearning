this is a very wellmade film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving  for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero its made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld charactersbr br a couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly onesided as it celebrates the heros successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out
