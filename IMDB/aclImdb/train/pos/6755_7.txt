ah noir my favourite genre otto premingers followup to laura is a film noir set in a postwar new york where corruption and violence run rampant it stars dana andrews as sergeant mark dixon a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors br br when he accidentally kills a murder suspect dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss tommy scalese dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead mans wife the beautiful morgan taylor of course in typical noir fashion things quickly go down hillbr br while the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom like most great noirs it is also wonderfully paced sucking the viewer in right from the startbr br still like most of premingers workmanlike films its not something id watch again it lacks the verbal wit of wilder the visual flamboyance of hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of welles like langs later work sidewalk feels very much a clone of what a noir should be instead of something really artistically genuine br br thematically the film is nothing special its about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal in one scene dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook the film flirting with the notion of predestination but this one scene is as far as otto goes or dares to take his ideasbr br the camera work is likewise disappointing theres no intelligence in ottos camera no effort is made to assign the camera to anything it doesnt play with space or architecture or empahsise the stepbystep police procedural its just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out meaningless though most people dont care about these things br br there is however one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters noir cage which itself enters a vehiclelift another cage and is taken up into the chief gangsters lair like lynchs blue velvet otto retopologizes the film constantly likens upstairs to hell this works well but the set design fails to reinforce it br br 710  otto seems content to follow the hawksian mould of what a noir is rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go like detour night in the city scarlet street in a lonely place act of violence bomberang and johnny eager where the sidewalk ends is one of those well made second tier film noirs its competent and engaging but lacks that extra special magic
