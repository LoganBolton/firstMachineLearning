where the sidewalk ends 1950br br where one ends another beginsbr br this is a prototypical film noir and as such pretty flawless from both style and content points of view the photography and night settings are first rate cinematographer joseph lashelle lets the drama ooze in scene after scene and the closeups on faces pure expressionism i can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks br br but the acting is first rate here and the plot features what i consider the core of most noir films the alienated male lead representing the many men returning home to a changed united states after the war and feeling lost themselves in fact not only is dana andrews really convincing as the troubled loner detective he has a small but important counterpart in the film the lead females first husband an decorated exgi fallen onto hard times and booze the fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance overall the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medalwearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head the woman transitions from one to the otherwe assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact we can still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage careening through a crisis to the highest kind of moral orderturning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with itbr br this movie belongs to andrews he plays a far more restrained and moving type than kirk douglas plays in a similar role in william wylers detective story made just one year later and andrews certainly is less theatrical you could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session the fact that andrews as detective dixon is morally struggling through it all and douglas as detective mcleod is not might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesnt gene tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic demurring and ultimately conventional and pretty type of womannot just a cardboard desirable but someone you want dixon to actually marry br br the criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama but is effective enough in its play with types and clich√©s the bit parts are kept snappy the small details like the portable craps table nice touches far from the character actors or the glamour of gambling in casablanca but then curtizs great movie is iconic even in the detailsit makes no effort to be subtle and real and penetrating but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring they come at opposite ends of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men bogart is beginning his active duty dixon and the man dixon has killed are all through through thoroughly but not washed upbr br its no accident that many possibly most film noirs have what you would call happy endings the man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self and the moviegoer then and now understands just how beautiful that must feel
