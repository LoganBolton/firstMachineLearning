where the sidewalk ends deserves to be a better known film directed by otto preminger the man who gave the world laura and this time hes got the same costars dana andrews and gene tierney it must be said that tierney here is underused in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to andrewsbr br he plays a tough hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him when suspicion falls on a cab driver tom tully he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because hes in love with the cabbies daughter gene tierney tierney by the way looks a little too elegant for the girl shes playing here and doesnt seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the storybr br the story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and its discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero by the end it turns into a morality tale with andrews developing a conscience over his crimebr br its fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast a good entry in the field of noir forcefully directed by preminger and nicely played by andrews and tierney despite the slight miscasting of her character
