were a long way from laura once again otto preminger directs dana andrews stars as a police detective named mark and gene tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyones favorite sophisticated murder mystery instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty harrowing realism while the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of new york society here were in the lowrent district of dark streets hoodlums cheap restaurants and crummy flats tierney gorgeous as ever now works as a departmentstore mannequin and lives in washington heights the neighborhood of the doll who once got a fox fur out of lauras mark mcpherson this time andrews is mark dixon an older sadder more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat br br where the sidewalk ends belongs to a subgenre of noir movies about police brutality focusing on cops who cant control their violent impulses like kirk douglass character in detective story dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his fathers criminal past where douglas is selfrighteous and blind to his own faults andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and selfloathing he accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster gary merrill whom he has been vainly pursuing for years instead a kindly cab driver is suspected because hes the father of the dead mans estranged and mistreated wife morgan gene tierney dixon falling in love with the wife of the man he killed tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away br br among noir protagonists dana andrews had this distinction he was incapable of appearing unintelligent even when playing an average joe as he usually did he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive more than that his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that hauntedand hauntingquality that was his essence as an actor he played ordinary guys cops and soldiers but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much his conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion guilt the inability ever to lighten up no other actor could have expressed so well the bottledup anger the slowburning pain the agonized intelligence of mark dixon he also has a muted tenderness a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking this comes out when he takes morgan to a restaurant where hes a regular and for the first time we see this cold brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress whose sarcasm cant hide her affection and concern for him when dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for morgans father he supplies it even though they recently argued and dixon threw a punch at him there are no words about loyalty or knowing hes a good guy deep down but we see it all in the mans anguished silence and his wifes resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn dixons goodness comes across through other peoples reactions to him as much as through andrewss deeply moving performance br br though dana andrews was a minor star he may be the quintessential forties man he goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat with that boxy midcentury silhouette further fortified by the fedora the glass of bourbon the cigarette he doesnt take out of his mouth when he talks he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity while many noirs romanticize the twofisted tough guy where the sidewalk ends offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the fa√ßade a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violencebr br andrews was sadly underrated in his own time he was the only one of the three protagonists in the best years of our lives not nominated for an academy award though his lowkey performance is far more compelling than frederic marchs hammy oscarwinning drunk fortunately andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality and now at last this littleknown film which contains his best performance can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set this series including a number of never before released titles such as nightmare alley and thieves highway suggests that twentiethcenturyfox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir
