perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto premingers where the sidewalks ends from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel night cry by frank rosenbergbr br dana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strongarm methods as much as he detests crooks when he hit someone his knuckles hurt and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain gary merrill who points up the title why are you always trying to push me in the gutter he asks andrews i have as much right on the sidewalk as youbr br dana andrews obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of a thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendettabr br by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of laura are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jailbr br using his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate a gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way a compromisebr br the film is one of the best detective films of the 50s with curious moral values also one of premingers best br br preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism
