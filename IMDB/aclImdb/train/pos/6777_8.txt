george cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch ronald colmans performance which earned him an oscar still stands up despite a few overwrought moments  its hard to forget his haunted countenance as he struts aimlessly around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life there are a number of interesting subtexts and cukor does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much the script by garson kanin and ruth gordon is brilliant mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from shakespeares king lear as a reference to both the films main theme of jealousy and colmans characters obsession with identitybr br several interesting things about this movie  superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors in other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets but i dont really think this storys primary concern is acting or the jobart of acting per se i think anthonys struggles represents a broader existential question a deeply buried uncertainty about identity theres a key i feel in his relationship with his exwife britta signe hasso he says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration and at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her im not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me especially because its his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top perhaps the implication is that anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship marriage implies a union of the soul in the traditional conception its unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film its not completely unprecedented hawks comedy his girl friday springs to mind among others but it is unusual and probably significant especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation in a way the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of selflove
