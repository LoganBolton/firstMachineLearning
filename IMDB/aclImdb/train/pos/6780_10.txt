colmans performance is aided by the brilliantly written script the gargantuan hollywood studios in the 30s and 40s were able to copy some of the german expressionistic film elements and incorporate them into hollywood films very good use of shadows and light and silhouette i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film and he starts reciting othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil already the viewer sees the text and the drama of shakespeare getting a hold of tony and off he goes on his journey of doom i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to bear her pleadings tony stop youre hurting me are chilling and suspenseful you just dont know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 23rds of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film masterful work from george cukor hes such as skillful director excellent film too bad they dont make em like they used to
