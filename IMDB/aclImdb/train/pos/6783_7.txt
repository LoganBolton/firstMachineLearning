if you like othello youll love this flick since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the playbr br the film has a great cast with signe hasso and shelley winters as the women in colmans life while edmond obrien plays the enterprising press agentbr br a couple of the supporting players i particularly liked were millard mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle and joe sawyer the 1940s answer to drew carey who plays the cop on the casebr br great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout
