i like my ronald colman dashing and debonair the fellow you see in such films as if i were king and kismet i like him as the epitome of civilization as in the lost horrizon and random harvest a brooding colman isnt a favorite of minebr br but in a double life precisely because his part as actor anthony john is so offbeat for him colman was recognized with a best actor oscar for 1947 it became his best known partbr br colman is an actor who really does take the method quite seriously hes just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and hes quite the jovial fellow for a change of pace now that that play has concluded its broadway run colman is bringing a revival of othello to new york about as opposite a part as you can getbr br his leading lady in both is his former wife signe hasso who loves him dearly but cant take his change of moods when hes at work colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back but hes heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous moor othello and hasso with her role as desdemonabr br unfortunately shelley winters as a poor waitress who a depressed colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor desdemona in the play killed in the same manner and now its a matter for homicide cop joe sawyerbr br colmans performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors id shudder to think so were there any unsolved homicides in or around laurence olivier and orson welles then they essayed othello br br i could never quite buy the story for that reason but i certainly do applaud ronald colman and what he did with the part im sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend william powell for life with father others in the running that year were gregory peck for gentlemens agreement john garfield for body and soul and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electrabr br colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including edmond obrien who finds himself in the unwanted part of cassio in colmans jealous fantasy still you will find no iago equivalent in a double life no one prodding the jealousy its all in his own mindbr br and that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century
