legend of dragoon is one of those littleknown games that people either love or hate some people claim its far too similar to other games namely the final fantasy serieswhich is understandable since it was originally intended to be sonys equivalent of final fantasy honestly i cant comment on the similarities beyond that as im not very familiar with the ff gamesbr br i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form but every time you attack you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time not only that sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of buttonmashing if you dont want to attack you can always guard which not only cuts any damage taken in half but raises your hit points without the use of healing potionsbr br the fmvs are quite welldone about the same quality as final fantasy 8s however the graphics during game play arent quite up to that standard theyre nice but they could have beenand honestly should have beenbetter the translation as well leaves something to be desired not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldnt have been allowed to passbr br another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party charactersone dies and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves while the death of the one character is often said to have no point it makes you realize early on that the characters while heroes are still just as mortal as the next person the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats so the transition game playwise is fairly smooth perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main characters love interest shana she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration while you can use her in your party she is insanely weaki dont even know what her dragoon powers are like as i disliked her so much i never used her the character rose by contrast is probably my favorite female character in any game ever shes no wimp and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful meru is quite strong as well while sometimes being an annoying talkative bratbr br the character designers were as most are inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever and didnt give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits seriously no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters but i will give them props as they do have females serving as knights in the various countriesbr br i cant comment much on the plot as honestly i didnt pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next im not sure if this says something about the plot itself or my gaming stylebr br all in all its a very enjoyable game it has its flaws but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters
