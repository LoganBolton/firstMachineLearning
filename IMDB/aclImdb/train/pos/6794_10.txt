i read thru most of the comments posted here  all i can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life this show unlike most game show was fun mr shatner whose brill in all that he does was again the hit of the show hes genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes hes fun  makes you smile  thats exactly what the show does also the dancers  questions the roundabout fashion theyre presented only add to the shows appeal and even though theres a great deal of money at stake its fun the pressure stress that exists in most game shows does not exist here several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers  choosing questions c like millionaire doesnt have similar time wasters all i can say is most of you have missed the whole concept the idea here is to have fun  enjoy yourself theres something for everyone qustions to test your knowledge eye candy the dancers suspense mr shatners wonderful funfilled personality well if that doesnt perkup guys up then i feel bad for you and if thats not enough you can get rich i really miss the show out of all the games shows that have ever been on  to be quite frank i hate game shows this is the one i really liked  truly miss the only other game show i ever liked was match game
