this episode is a bit confusing some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but i have to say i was a bit confused from the beginningbr br clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of fairview mental institution and is made fun of for believing that hes a superhero clark is told that the life that he knew was all in his head delusional he also find some things that are unusual marthas married to lionel lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge and lana is devoted to clark but he finds one familiarity someone else whos devoted to clark chloe he also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of smallville and the doctor is an escapee from the phantom zonebr br this episode reminds me right back to a buffy episode called normal again where buffy begins to have vividdaydreams about a mental asylum the doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was in fact crazy her parents were still married they still lived in la her friends didnt exist angel was never her boyfriend and she didnt have a sister called dawn demons and vampires also didnt exist both episodes are a bit sad because doctors arent just telling the characters that its all a figment of her imagination but it tells us what it really is fiction and it brings us back to reality its nice though to have a sense of reality every once in a while but we watch these shows to escape from reality its again nice because the characters have to overcome new challenges
