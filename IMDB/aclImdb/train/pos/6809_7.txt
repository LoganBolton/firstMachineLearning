this was a pretty good film im not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment but i didnt want to take a chance anyway near the end of the film the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory i cant remember the first passage he reads but the second one is genesis 96 he says its genesis 912 but he actually quotes verse 6 this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment its too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today did anybody ever hear of john jay the first supreme court justice in the history of this country he said that the bible is the best of all books too bad weve lost that view in america
