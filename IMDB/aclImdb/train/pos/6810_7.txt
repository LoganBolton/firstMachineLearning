after reading the book i happened across this dvd at walmart for 3 bucks and thought sure what the hell i got the dvd and watched it last night when i started watching it i checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes i thought ok cool it seemed to run rather slowly knowing the story and how much of it there was by the time i got to the actual killings i was like how much time does this have left checked one minute what the hell i felt incredibly cheated thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall storybr br but then i happily noticed that the dvds scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2 i still had another hour and a half to go i then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie even more so than the firstbr br i admit that i have not seen the 1967 original film despite my sincerest desire to i have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film for a twopart tv miniseries that is i think the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me but still very well done the first half drags on a bit while the second half is much more gripping i think they should have proportioned the movie more like capote did his book 13 before the murders 13 after and 13 after the killers are arrested instead the film makes it more 12 before the murders 14 after and 14 after the killers are arrested again this makes the second half more exciting but at the same time less compelling while making the first half drag on and onbr br now i look back and realize i have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on so i will shut the hell up go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind br br nick houston
