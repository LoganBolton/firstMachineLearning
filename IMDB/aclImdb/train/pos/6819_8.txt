i found time at the top an entertaining and stimulating experience the acting while not generally brilliant was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic it is certainly one of the better works in the genre childrens scifi normally i would say that canada the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children and time at the top does nothing to discount this theory i dont think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them both are in abundance in this film the special effects are good without detracting from the story or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations it would have been very easy to inject an overload of sfx in this film but it would have totally destroyed its entire raison detre br br the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy overall this film is highly satisfactory and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through childrens eyes or those that try to like myself now i really must read the original book as soon as possible
