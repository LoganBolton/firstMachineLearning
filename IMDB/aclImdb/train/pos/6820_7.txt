the movie was much better than the other reviewer stated its a nice family movie it has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel the story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building of course no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girls family in many ways she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run it reminds me of a hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself it seemed to be aimed more towards children about 612 years maybe a bit older and its pretty much pg or g rated im an adult who can appreciate a nice family movie  i guess the other reviewer isnt
