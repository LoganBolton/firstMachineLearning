john cassavetes 1977 film opening night is what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist overlooked it is an excellent film in its own right and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film its not a perfect film in that at two hours and twenty four minutes its about a half hour too long and theres a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character myrtle gordon played by gena rowlands the wife of cassavetes long after weve gotten the point but only woody allens masterpiece another woman which also starred rowlands eleven years later is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman yet rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal and it was well deserved often this film written by cassavetes is easily compared to his earlier and inferior film a woman under the influence but its a spurious comparison rowlands character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start as well as coming from a blue collar background while her characters in this film and in allens film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions in this film its the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as myrtles younger doppelganger while in allens film its her characters own pastÂ… many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic seeing myrtle surround herself with enablers such as a stage manager who tells her during opening night ive seen a lot of drunks in my time but ive never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up youre great but this is wrong for alcohol isnt her problem nor is her chain smoking they are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction and much to cassavetes credit as a storyteller he never lets us find out exactly whats wrong with myrtle and despite her coming through in the end theres no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence this sort of end without resolution links cassavetes directly with the more daring european directors of the recent past who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience and forcing their viewers to cogitate even if it hurtsbr br yet the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama whether or not myrtle gordon does recover after the films universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide and as we have seen before that lid closes ones choices do matter
