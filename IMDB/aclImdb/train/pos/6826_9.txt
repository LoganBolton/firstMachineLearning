john cassavetes opening night is fantastic and fascinating fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination fascinating because it never ceases surprising us with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes anyone who appreciates characters wont be able to take their eyes off the screenbr br the story of an unstable actress myrtle gordon gena rowlands trying to put herself together for a play fighting her demons opening night is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world all of cassavetes characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater so half of the film takes place on a stage either where the performers do their job or at backstage where producers and writers and directors do their jobbr br cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience but the audience in the cinema because there is another audience in the theater of the film that doesnt know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance and thats essentially what it is its just that the audience in the theater doesnt get to see backstage the way we do they dont experience gena rowlands exuberance before she goes out to that stage but most importantly they dont know the reasons why she acts the way she doesbr br i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor myrtle rowland says shes an actress and thats the only thing she knows how to do and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer it would be really difficult to tell when hes saying the truth because i would know hes an actor and he can fake anything at any time a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her throughwe suspect if shes being real the rest of the characters suspect toobr br there is the writer sarah joan blondell who cant understand why myrtle doesnt understand the character shes written for her theres the director manny ben gazzara who cant accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it the producer david paul stewart who doesnt know where to stand and myrtles costar maurice cassavetes himself who cant deal with the love they have for each otherbr br when she witnesses the death of a teenager a fan all of this comes together and affects myrtle but no one knows if her delusions are for real they dont say anything because they dont want to upset her but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts at times we can tell that everyone has had it during these moments cassavetes brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to thembr br here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking just like cassavetes way of making cinema and in this aspect the performances are more important here than in shadows because the characters are involved in a bigger picture a bigger story that steps out of the trivialbr br but in another aspect the actual way of making cinema this movie is no different from shadows theres a beautiful thing in the way al rubans camera shoots the characters when someones talking the camera doesnt focus on him it shoots the person who is listening so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other ones saying sometimes they dont care sometimes they are happy sometimes devastatedbr br improvisation might still be there though among all these wonderful performances near the end theres an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking nonstop whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder we have just got to watch and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it showsit doesnt get more natural than that
