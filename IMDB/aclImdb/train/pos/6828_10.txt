broadway and film actorturneddirector john cassavetes from rosemarys babycreates a masterpiece with this 1977 film it stars gena rowlands john cassavetes himself ben gazzara joan blondell paul stewart zohra lampert laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk the premise of the film an aging stage and film actress gena rowlandsreevaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph the movie has a slow pace and a dark moody frightening quality it has a 60s cinematic look and it even reminded me of polanskis rosemarys baby without the supernatural horror the fears here are the ones every successful actress has she is getting old and she will become useless in her career furthermore she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality humanity and merit she has lived only for her career she has no children doesnt do charitable deeds etc the gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film she is falling apart shes in a crisis gena rowlands really gets into the characters tormented psyche and acts the part quite well she is a terrific actress and this 70s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers its a movie with lots of deepseated emotion but has a cold cynical feeling as if cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70s generation either that or this movie is a product of the 70s which was itself cynical in many aspects nixons deception watergate vietnam etc although the production values are not great and this film is not wellknown its a very haunting film with haunting moods kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late 80s
