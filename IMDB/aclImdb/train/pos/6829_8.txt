gena rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of hers she becomes increasingly deluded from reality and as a result her emotional turmoil intrudes with her work as an actress in the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything yet still manages to engage her audience makes the film interesting if a bit selfimportant as a parallel of cassavettes own struggles as a filmmaker theres so many ideas thrown around and as result it becomes a bit muddled im still pondering the relation between the dead fan and rowlands among many other things but the way theyre presented in their rawest form makes it a consistently interesting and thoughtprovoking film would be great on a double bill with mulholland drivebr br
