this is one of my alltime favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some its well worth seeing a corporate lawyer richard chamberlain is dragged into a case involving city aborigines and this is no ordinary case ok a man has died but it wasnt exactly a normal killing there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic  oppressive the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about city vs tribal aborigines and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways uh huh chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to whats happening although no matter how many times ive seen this i cant quite grasp the exact connection this is a very eerie and creepy film and is a fine example of peter weirs ability to create tension out of nothing the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally its the easiest way out and the scariest 10 out of 10 and highly recommended
