many reviews here explain the story and characters of opening night in some detail so i wont do that i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of lifebr br at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how easy it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms herbr br almost  but not quite at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself im going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage it seems almost sadistic when myrtles director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance he knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at allbr br some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtles downward path i believe this is truly her opening night  she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward it is tremendously movingbr br gena rowlands is superb the film is superb thank you mr cassavetes wherever you are
