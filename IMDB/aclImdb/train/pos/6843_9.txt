writerdirector brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called somewhat unfairly hitchcock imitations contrary to popular belief de palma doesnt ripoff hitchcock he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent modern way like hitchcock de palma is known for mixing bloodsoaked death with macabre humorbr br dressed to kill made way back in 1980 is perhaps de palmas most wellknown hitchcockian film and its probably his best as well the story involves a crossdressing serial killer stalking both a burntout housewife played by angie dickinson and a streetwise hooker played by nancy allenbr br yes it will remind you distinctly of psycho but de palmas flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative the museum sequence is particularly wellscored and edited the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film dressed to kill may not be a complete original but id say its definitely worth your time rated r 105 minutes 9 out of 10
