i just finished watching dressed to killwhich is written and directed by brian de palmathe dvd had both ther rated version and the unrated versioni chose the unrated versionsince i have yet to view the r rated versioni cant be completely sure of the differencethere is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this versioni guess you could call this scene soft core pornif this sort of thing may offend youi would suggest you view the r rated versionbut i digressany comment from here on refers to the unrated versionthis is a murder mystery psychological horrorsuspense moviethere is very little violence and bloodthere is however one death sequence of notethe act of the killing itself is fairly graphichowever the blood it self does not look realit is reminiscent of how a 70s slasher film would looki believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itselfto give the scene a low budget feelmost of the violenceor rather possibility of suchis impliedthe film is very well pacedas far as i can tell every scene had a purposewhich i find very rare when compared to many of todays films anywayi also thought the acting was goodespecially angie dickinsonand micheal cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his rolewhich works brilliantly in this casethe movie also has one great twist in itin my mindalthough some people might find it predictablethe only complaintand its really more of an observationi have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out moreespecially considering she has a fair amount of screen timebut i think she does a good job with what she is givenand this doesnt really take away from the quality of the filmthe film also has a strong moral to itwhich is even more relevant todaybut the movie doesnt hit you over the head with iti also really liked the musical scorecomposed by pino dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original psychoto methis music really elevated the moviei thought this movie was brilliantfor medressed to kill1980is 1010
