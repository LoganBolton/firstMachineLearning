may contain minor spoilersbr br dressed to kill having just seen it for the first time the other day is a movie with some terrific sequences some decent performances and a nice though obvious hitchcock ripoff plot twist at the end its just too bad certain things quite obvious prevent it from being a classicbr br dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women could have been more but the movie never tells us and the search for the killer by three people a brainy kid whose mom was a victim a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kids mother there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz angie dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller and micheal caine as doctor rober elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye though by no standard is anyone really outstanding on the other hand denis franz later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show nypd blue is embarrassing as an overexaggerated ruthless hateful detective though he takes little screen time so it doesnt hurt the movie that much keith gordon the brain child is decent but is almost too smart to really be believablebr br what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death i also love the sequence at the doctors office that reveals the identity of the killer which really makes the whole film come together at once and theres a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic still theres another situation when liz is on a train running from what may be the killer that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes as a thriller its tense and quite often believable as a crime drama it often falters especially with the incomplete ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end theres also a needless and way too long dream sequence at the end in which they had the audacity to shoot someones foot for what seemed minutes at a time this was an up and down experience one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement and the next would make me squirm and ask why at more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better filmbr br scary movie fans should like this it still stands as a better film than most of todays slasher flicks maybe it was a better film in its time but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone
