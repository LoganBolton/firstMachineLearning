in france its considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him however a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects carrie 1976 the fury 1978 scarface 1983 without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock here in dressed to kill its impossible not to think of vertigo 1958 for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in psycho 1960 about our involved film i dont want to revive the old debate does de palma rip off hitchcock instead i would tend to be generous and to classify dressed to kill in the category of de palmas winners alongside sisters 1973 and obssession 1976 with however some reservations and theyre the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palmas rabid fans and his detractorsbr br if theres one sure thing in dressed to kill which can generate general agreement among filmlovers its de palmas virtuosity in directing he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura the audience is easily glued in front of the screen this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures by the way in psycho there were also long silent suspenseful partsbr br but the main drawback in de palmas 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot cant be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime then shes suspected by the police and has to act on her own with a little help from the victims son from the scene in the subway onwards to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isnt demeaned at all its a menu which smells the reheated and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one yes its superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function one figures its almost gratuitous filler perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows and even before who the killer isbr br the two central mainsprings in de palmas set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism the latter theme is well present in dressed to kill from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie and the filmmaker isnt afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom sidebr br i dont want to demean at all de palmas work his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects twenty six years after the controversy he aroused amid moviegoers isnt ready to subside
