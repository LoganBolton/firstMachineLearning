kate miller angie dickinson is having problems in her marriage and otherwiseenough to see a psychologist when her promiscuity gets her into trouble it also involves a bystander liz blake nancy allen who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killerbr br dressed to kill is somewhat important historically it is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through hide and seek 2005 its odd then that director brian de palma was basically trying to crib hitchcock for example de palma literally lifts parts of vertigo 1958 for dressed to kills infamous museum scene dressed to kills shower scenes as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to psycho 1960 de palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of hitchcocks favorite composer bernard herrmann the similarities do not end therebr br but de palma whether by accident or skill manages to make an oblique turn from or perhaps transcend his influence with dressed to kill having an attitude structure and flow that has been influential maybe partially because of this influence dressed to kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time countless subsequent directors have taken their hitchcocklike de palma and honed it improving nearly every element so that watched now after 25 years worth of influenced thrillers much of dressed to kill seems agonizingly paced structurally clunky and plotwise ineptbr br one aspect of the film that unfortunately hasnt been improved is dressed to kills sex and nudity scenes both dickinson and allen treat us to full frontal nudity allens being from a very skewed angle and de palma has lingering shots of dickinsons breasts strongly implicit masturbation and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films quite a few scenes approach softcore porn im no fan of prudishnessquite the opposite our cultures puritanical monogamistic sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me so from my perspective its lamentable that dressed to kills emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film perhaps it has been desired but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirtsbr br de palmas direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than de palma does it he has an odd characteristic approach to closeups and hes fond of shots from interesting angles such as overhead views and james whalelike tracking across distant cutaways in the sets of course later directors have been flashier but its difficult to say that theyve been better viewed for filmmaking prowess at least the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following kate through the intricately nested cubes of the metropolitan museum of artbr br on the other hand from a point of view caring about the story and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache as well as cultural facts external to the film the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqué once the first murder occurs things improve but because of the films eventual influence much of the improvement now seems a bit clichéd and occasionally hokeybr br the performances are mostly good although michael caine is underused and dickinson has to exit sooner than wed like but the exit is necessary and very effective dressed to kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end but because of facts not contained in the picture itself hasnt exactly aged well at this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an examplebut not the best even for that eraof some of de palmas directorial flair
