a great suspense movie with terrific slow camerawork adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy directorwriter brian de palma does a super hitchcockimitation many called it a ripoff with this film and the 2351 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camerawork and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formattedfortv tapesbr br the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a prenypd dennis franz who has hair here br br the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodiesbr br there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though its apparent who the killer is its still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women
