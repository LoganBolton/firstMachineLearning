i was born in 1982 most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80s and 90s i watched the groove tube for the first time in 2001 when i was 19br br and i found it hilariousbr br so for anybody who thinks that something dated cant be quite funny 30 years laterthink again its funny even if you have no idea what the 70s were like and the thought of bellbottom pants make you cringe who can argue with a bozo the clown type who reads adult literature there is plenty to laugh at the scrotal puppet show at the end is the best
