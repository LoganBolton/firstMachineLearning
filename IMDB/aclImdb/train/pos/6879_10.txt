the groove tube was one of only two ken shapiro movies the other one being the equally zany modern problems this one is just a fullscale parody of tv aside from shapiro  who apparently didnt do anything after modern problems  the movie also stars chevy chase and henry winklers cousin richard belzer the three cast members plus some other people in smaller roles appear in various skits one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritolspoofing commercial in which hes describing the medicine as his wife strips and it ends with her humping him theres also a pornographic news program an irritating cooking show and the epic tale of some drug dealersbr br anyway the whole things just a real hoot in my opinion the three best tvspoofing movies are this one plus tunnelvision and kentucky fried movie although i might also include the truman show really funnybr br i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro
