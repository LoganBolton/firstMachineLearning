this is a unique and bold film its energetic with highly developed characters very good performances br br i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think br br bret carr dares to look inward ask questions and dig underneath the surface by the nature of the film it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well it can take some courage to do this i can see how some closeminded people might find this quite disturbing however i found it thoughtprovoking much more than just entertainmentbr br bret carr is truly an original filmmaker with vision i am curious to see what he will do nextbr br watch him
