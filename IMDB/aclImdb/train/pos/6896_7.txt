this is the last of four swashbucklers from france ive scheduled for viewing during this christmas season the others in order of viewing were the uninspired the black tulip 1964 from the same director as this one but not nearly as good the surprisingly effective lady oscar 1979 which had originated as a japanese manga and the splendid cartouche 1962 actually i had watched this one not too long ago on latenight italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterionbr br incidentally fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the aforementioned cartouche not just cast and crew members producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine cinematographer christian matras actor noel roquevert but plotwise as well  in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier jeanpaul belmondos cartouche had also had a brief military spell whos loved by a fiery girl in this case gypsy gina lollobrigida while hes himself obsessed by an impossible love here its none other than the kings daughter as in the later film too fanfan an ideally cast gerard philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years time is flanked by two funloving yet cowardly men one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroines own father and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks the ageing roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl for the record lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film rene clairs delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit 1952br br fanfan proved to be a big boxoffice hit on its homeground and even copped a surprising but welldeserved best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris 1951 detective story 1951 othello umberto d and viva zapata in fact its popularity ensured its rerelease in a computercolored version presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldnt touch a blackandwhite product with a tenfoot pole and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant being obviously a foreignlanguage title theres also the dubious choice of an englishdubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done theres simply no substitute for the original br br fanfan la tulipe a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour contains about as much comedy as the expected action and romance while some may find this overwhelming i dont agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowskis equally droll the adventures of gerard 1970 that said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent and the film itself rather adult at times with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout when viewed backtoback with vintage hollywood fare as i did now the climax then is quite ingenious the enemy forces who amusingly are made to speak in speededup gibberish are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the kings amazement who as portrayed by marcel herrand  bestknown for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carnes children of paradise 1945  is himself something of a lecherbr br ps an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christianjaques promising champagne for savages 1964 for months now but despite programming it three times already with a tentative fourth one slated for next week they have yet to show it even so i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile equally culled from latenight italian tv screenings the threehour epic la chartreuse de parme 1948 also starring gerard philippe the second twin 1967 and the legend of frenchie king 1971 with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale
