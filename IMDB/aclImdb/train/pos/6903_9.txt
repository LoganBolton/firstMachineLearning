this littleappreciated movie is one of my favorites i can watch it over and over dreyfus and braga are masterful but raul julia steals the show a tongueincheek menacingly humorous gomez addams with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this ofttold storybr br generally untrumpeted and unappreciated moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen two thumbs up
