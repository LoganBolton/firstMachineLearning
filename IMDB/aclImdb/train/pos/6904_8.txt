this is one the few movies i can watch over and over if youve never seen it give it a shot richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly it reminds me of julias untimely demise it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear
