i enjoyed this film it was funny cute silly and entertaining had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly dont understand no it wasnt the grapes of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck but it was an enjoyable filmbr br julia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man the story is a little silly to be sure but it this isnt high drama folks i happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it and im glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile and i watch it a couple times a year
