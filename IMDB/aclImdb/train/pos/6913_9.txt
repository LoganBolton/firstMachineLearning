as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesnt take acting too seriously im always amused by those who treat it as great art this movie skewers the actors craft mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughsbr br a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the part of a lifetime by the neonazi head of the secret service he plays it to the hilt gets the dictators girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa and turns the tables on his captors beautifullybr br lots of great shtick by the leads lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard and fun little cameos abound sammy davis jr makes light of himself jonathan winters plays a semiretired american businessman with something else going on and raul julia sonia braga and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptionalbr br this is a dumb movie but it has lots of beautiful locations in brazil a humorous script and good actors doing their thing and looking like theyre actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only playacting
