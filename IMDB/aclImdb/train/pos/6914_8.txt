this movie contains one of richard dreyfusss greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna who is the dictators mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country madonnas evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movies entertainment value and the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect i liked this movie
