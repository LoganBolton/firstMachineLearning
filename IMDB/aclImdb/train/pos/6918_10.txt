a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over the cast is very good theres plenty of action and stewart gets the girl and his revenge with a twist in the end ive seen this film several times and always watch when its on amc or cable highly recommended
