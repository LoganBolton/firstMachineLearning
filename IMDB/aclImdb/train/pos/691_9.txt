ill come clean the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to bedifferent perhaps in not such a good waybr br but i was wrong after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later needless to say i was not disappointedbr br the film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head i wont give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in its realismbr br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtprovoking momentsbr br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve
