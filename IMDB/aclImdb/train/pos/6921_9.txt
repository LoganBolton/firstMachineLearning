keep in mind im a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time how ive overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me to me this is a better film then the much lauded high noon its a great western with excellent acting and a great story the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed
