contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart and this movie proves it this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester riflehas only one weak spot i can think of the casting of will geer as a very unearplike wyatt earp the casting of the villains was goodstephen mcnally as surly dutch henrydan duryea as waco johnny dean and john mcintireversatile at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great id stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today they wouldnt stand a chance
