this complicated western was a milestone in the career of james stewart after his return from war service wanting to change his image by doing a western which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the 50s since its very impressive too bad it wasnt photographed in technicolorbr br stewart wins first prize for the gun that won the west but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when its stolen shelley winters is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and stephen mcnally is the local bad boy gunman in dodge city will geer is wyatt earp and dan duryea is shelleys bad boyfriend and wouldnt you know that it being a universalinternational film tony curtis and rock hudson both quite unknown at the time have bit rolesbr br an interesting sequence features the first indian attack whereby charles drake reveals himself to be a coward who rides off leaving shelley alone in the horsedrawn wagon he later redeems himself but its just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to anotherbut finally ending up with the rightful ownerbr br stephen mcnally and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic but not quite as duel in the suns blazing guns finale mcnally makes the perfect villain and dan duryea is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the 40s as a lowlife gunslingerbr br tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by anthony mann and its fun to see rock hudson credited as young bull wearing indian war paint and tony curtis as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive shelley wintersbr br well worth viewing and definitely an above average story
