winchester 73 is a great story and thats what i like about it its not your everyday westernit uses a rifle which passes hands from various charactersas a mechanism for telling the story about these people rock hudson plays an indian chief jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west its important to note for those politically correct typesthey kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse by todays standards its still pretty violent but its a great story and worth watching enjoy
