for the viewer who comes upon it long after its making winchester 73 has something in common with casablanca while you watch it you get this feeling that youre looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great in other words its a seminal workbr br winchester 73 is a joy to watch the broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable but mostly because youve seen them copied so many times in later movies and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you the dialogue the pacing and manns direction are excellent stewart shines in particular and if youre a fan this is a mustsee but he is not alone in delivering a good performance remarkably many of the most thoughtful andor witty lines go to minor characters because this makes these characters much more than cardboard cutouts it lent additional realism to the film br br this is a remarkably underrated film and well worth keeping an eye out for the dvd also contains an interview with stewart which provides some background on the film
