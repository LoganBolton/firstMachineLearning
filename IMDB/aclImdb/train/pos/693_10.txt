this is an almost actionless film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time cant tell reality from hallucinationbr br dominic monaghan as jack is truly believable confused and scared but lethargic and at times blankly accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what hes seeing and find a way to sleepbr br introduce a talking dog another hallucination and children that suddenly appear in jacks bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there more hallucination and you have an interesting mind boggling 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more
