buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome of course we can go back to howard hawkss red river 1948 or further still to john fords my darling clementine 1946 but if we want to stick with this single decade then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that eras initial year one is the gunfighter an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger ringo facing his last shootout another from that same year is winchester 73 and its worth noting that millard mitchell appears in both as grim mustached highly realistic range riders in the gunfighter hes the town marshal expected to arrest ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang in winchester hes the sidekick to jimmy stewart a kind of horatio to stewarts hamlet in this epictragic tale the plot is simple enough stewarts lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match beating the meanest man in the west stephen mcnally who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father when the brother steals the gun stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier meeting up with both outlaws and indians in one wonderful bit two future stars  rock hudson and tony curtis  play an indian chief and a us cavalry soldier  during a well staged pitchedbattle dan duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader while shelly winters just before she began to gain weight is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together today filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen but anthony mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time with not a minute wasted such western legends as bat masterson and wyatt earp terrifically played by will geer make brief appearances adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature the final battle between good and bad brothers high atop a series of jutting rock canyons is now legendary among western buffs its also worth noting that stewart however much associated he became with western films does what is actually his first western leading man role here  yes he was in destry rides again eleven years earlier but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns
