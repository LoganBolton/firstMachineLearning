my favorite movie genre is the western its really the only movie genre that is of american origin and despite sergio leone no one does them quite like americansbr br right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is winchester 73 it was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director anthony mann and actor james stewart it was also a landmark film in which stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from universal many such deals followed for players making them as rich as the moguls who employed thembr br anthony mann up to this point had done mostly b pictures noir type stuff with no real budgets just before winchester 73 mann had done a fine western with robert taylor devils doorway that never gets enough praise im sure james stewart must have seen it and decided mann was the person he decided to partner withbr br in this film mann also developed a mini stock company the way john ford was legendary for besides stewart others in the cast like millard mitchell steve brodie dan duryea john mcintire jay c flippen and rock hudson would appear in future mann filmsbr br its a simple plot james stewart is obsessed with finding a man named dutch henry brown and killing him why i wont say but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of james stewart on screen anthony mann reached into jimmy stewarts soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we havebr br the hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film after stewart and sidekick millard mitchell are disarmed by wyatt earp played by will geer because guns arent carried in earps dodge city theres a shooting contest for a winchester rifle in dodge city and the betting favorite is dutch henry brown played with menace by stephen mcnally stewart mitchell and geer go into the saloon and stewart and mcnally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that arent there look at the closeups of stewart and mcnally they say more than 10 pages of dialogbr br another character stewart runs into in the film is waco johnny dean played by dan duryea who almost steals the film this may have been duryeas finest moment on screen hes a psychopathic outlaw killer whos deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns br br another person stewart meets is shelley winters whos fianc√© is goaded into a showdown by duryea and killed her best scenes are with duryea whos taken a fancy to her she plays for time until she can safely get away from him guess who she ultimately winds up withbr br there are some wonderful performances in some small roles there aint a sour note in the cast john mcintire as a shifty indian trader jay c flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and rock hudson got his first real notice as a young indian chief even john alexander best known as theodore roosevelt in arsenic and old lace has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both mcnally and stewart stop at different timesbr br mann and stewart did eight films together five of them westerns and were ready to do a sixth western night passage when they quarreled and mann walked off the set the end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films
