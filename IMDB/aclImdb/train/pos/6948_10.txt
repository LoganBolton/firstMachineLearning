the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time i saw 24 the speed things are happening is amazing and its so surprising thrilling and even interesting its almost as if you are reading a book once you start it its very hard to stop from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu i was sitting 640 hours which means 10 episodes sounds funny and crazy but im the kind of guy which when he is interested he just cant stopthis series is one of the best of its kind and its build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together recommended in every way
