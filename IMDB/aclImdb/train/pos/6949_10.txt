addictive is an adjective ive heard many times when talking of certain tv shows most recently dramas like lost heroes and prison break have earned that description however as compelling as they may be and they really are i can wait a few days before i see the next episode of either series even prison break which some have lazily classified as the new 24 with all due respect there can be no such thing and for a good reason no other silverscreen thriller is based on a realtime structure thats what sets 24 apart from any other show and thats why i practically have to watch an entire season on dvd in seven days or less once the frickin clock starts ticking its impossible to tune outbr br an episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of nypd blue and more recently deadwood having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours one per ep the actual running time is 41 minutes the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since hill street blues introduced nonlinear storytelling a mandatory element nowadays and it truly paid offbr br ironically enough the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding fortunately creators joel surnow and robert cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere looking extremely relaxed jack bauer kiefer sutherland is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter kimberly elisha cuthbert and minutes later being tender with teri leslie hope the wife with whom he has just reconciled as in the sopranos though something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner not only has kim snuck out of her room jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately at midnight im afraid so bauer is a ctu counter terrorist unit agent and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of david palmer dennis haysbert an africanamerican presidential candidate who will be in los angeles for the whole day oh right i almost forgot events occur on the day of the california presidential primary no time for napping then jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case unfortunately he has a tendency to ignore protocol and that doesnt sit well with george mason xander berkeley a slimy man from division who has been asked to interfere with the operationbr br the plot is very dense making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly the writing is sharp and precise the attention to detail unsurpassed and the suspense is consistently skyhigh mainly thanks to the realtime trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline levelbr br another great quality of this pilot is the characterization most genre shows scifi and thriller tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on a textbook example is csi where character development is minimal but then again that matches the shows unique style whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people among whom jack sutherlands best role  ever and palmer the real revelation of the show stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only the former divided between job and family reckless but humane the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity a couple of supporting parts border on stereotype mason and tony almeida especially but two factors ought to be taken into account a this is the first episode b theres so much going on most viewers wont even complain about a flaw or two after all how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy a missing teenager and a huge explosion  and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the seasonbr br tick tock tick tock
