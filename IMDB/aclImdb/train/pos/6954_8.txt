this movie was one of the funniest movie ive seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me not since my big fat greek wedding 2002 has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense easily has intricate as last years mr and mrs smith 2005 in its use of parody espionage in mr and mrs smith and sex in my super exgirlfriend directors ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama between crazy and downright ludicrous is great never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy at the same time this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance in some ways its so evident that its great to see how it plays out just like in real life sometimes the truth is so evident that one cant really see it easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie 1982 possibly a nine depends on how it appears on a second viewing
