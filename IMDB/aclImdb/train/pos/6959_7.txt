well this is an ivan reitman film with the rare exception ivan likes to entertain his films generally arent deep but they are often entertaining enough my super exgirlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so grand and i love her portrayals i like luke wilson too and rainn wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isnt very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before its a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a headache and dont want to strain your brain its escapist fun and theres nothing wrong with that when you strip away the supergirl stuff youre left with a story about relationships and relationships gone bad its a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love not all of them take being dumped as well as they coulda slice of life with a twist
