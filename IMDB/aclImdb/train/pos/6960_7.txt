a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus she refuses him but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway and there it starts  a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero it cant be a secret that things between them are going to be problematicbr br in short a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film and imo it succeeds at being a nice film its no masterpiece but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion  the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is even with the superhero thing going believablebr br so thin story but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema timebr br 7 out of 10 broken hearts
