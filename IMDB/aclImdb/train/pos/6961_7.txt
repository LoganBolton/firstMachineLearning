the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many superpeople movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didnt expect uma thurman performed as average in ggirls role surprisingly i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch ggirls and average matts adventures especially to cheer up your partner 710 in my collection
