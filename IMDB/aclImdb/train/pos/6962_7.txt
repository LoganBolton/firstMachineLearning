my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable and you know what it was but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of i know that this was a very cheesy movie but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and thats what made the movie really workbr br jenny johnsonscary thats my best friends actual name is not your typical average librarian looking woman when matt your average male asks her out hes in for more than he expected hes asked ggirl out on a date the super hero of the world but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart but jenny wont have it since hes fallen for another girl hannah and she will make his life a living hell i mean lets face it he couldnt have chosen a better girl to break up withbr br the effect were corny but you seriously move past them quickly the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie it was such a step up from prime my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldnt really take seriously its just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it anyone couldbr br 710
