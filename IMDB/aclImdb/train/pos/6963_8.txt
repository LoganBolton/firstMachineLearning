a big surprise probably because i was expecting it to suck the reviews were pretty dismissive of it even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero and finds when he wants to break up with her that shes kind of a psycho i kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did sure it doesnt make as much of its awesome premise as it could and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the films universe but i cant blame it for that uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero ggirl and ive discovered after several years of disliking him that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub hes given two of the best comic performances of 2006 the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex its one of the funniest sex scenes ever my only real complaint is that they make ggirl a bit too much of a psycho like almost unbelievably so maybe with some background i could have accepted it better i can forgive its flaws though because i had a really good time watching it underrated for sure
