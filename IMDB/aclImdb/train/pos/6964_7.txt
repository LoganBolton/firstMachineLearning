on paper this looked like a great concept average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis however director ivan reitman and writer don payne of the simpsons almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero ggirl played by striking uma thurman come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders luke wilson following his rescue by ggirl from the statue of liberty jenny curiously asks matt what was ggirl like matt replies shes kind of nutty i think the intent was to have jenny thurman be this lonely young woman who has no one in her life isolated by her great physical powers thurman does the best she can but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friendbr br my super exgirlfriend is also a victim of bad timing coming on the tail end of superman returns which plays superhero straight up so to speak with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought my super exgirlfriend was funny and enjoyed the movie given that this is an ivan reitman movie this could have been a lot better reitman starts with a great premise and really squanders it first off we all love the hero here neither jenny nor ggirl is really all that likable this is surprising for uma thurman who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence in the beginning her jenny ggirl is just plain weird shocking because if there is a woman who can play a superhero she is thurmanshe looks great only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic instead of caricature although my super ex is not a straight superhero story rather a romantic comedy of sorts it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain here we have professor bedlam aka barry eddie izzard who really is evil lite he is no lex luthor no plans for global domination bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against ggirl and expectedly it has to do with their shared past what is bizarre you dont know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or ggirl luke wilsons matt is just some dude who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense and this dilutes his likable charm this does however work in the comic sex scene with jenny matt while dating jenny ggirl realizes that he is in love with his coworker hannah perky anna faris so how does matt break up with ggirl well its not pretty and for the most part hilariousbr br dramatic superhero movies work romantic comedies with chemistry work what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies everyone loves the hero however hero nut job maybe not with all uma thurmans talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings my super exgirlfriend is fun and funny though given all involved the movie could have been super
