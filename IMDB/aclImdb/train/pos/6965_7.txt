this movie answers the question how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent clinging needy jealous  and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal womenbr br without spoiling the movie i can safely assure you it does not but theres great fun to be had along the way uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial superheroine an uberbabe mysteriously named ggirl who unlike most in her sisterhood is not always dedicated to truth justice and the american way br br thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft yet somehow still fetching curator jenny when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival ggirl goes ballistic and what follows is not pretty its funny but its not pretty br br its a delightful premise hell hath no fury like a superheroine scorned and those involved dont altogether carry it off but it has its moments and i think ill get the dvdbr br i liked this movie
