just as the new bsg wasnt what fans of the original series were expecting caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting for the most part it is a very interesting if not somewhat selfinvolved show or at least the pilot isbr br if youre looking for the big cgi thrills of the new bsg youll be sorely disappointed if you liked the drama youll probably find something you like and maybe even identify withbr br the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society the writers also manage to tackle humans playing gods and the creation or recreation of human life it will be interesting to see how this plays outbr br i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others but all in all it was promising a small part of me wishes or hopes there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there aside from the back story i mentioned but that would probably convolute the storyline too much like bsg ill have to wait and see if caprica grows on me but its way too early to tellbr br it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series but im willing to give it a chance overall i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before throwing in the proverbial towel
