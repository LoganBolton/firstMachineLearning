of course the average scifi battle star gallactica fan will hate this that kind of makes me happy i dont like those cheesy scifi shows especially battlestar gallactica and that is why i like this showbr br the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this the unconventional scifi way and it was worth it i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just scifi nerdsbr br this is probably the most promising show since lost it has the most interesting clever and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly uniquebr br what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime from young teens running around shooting guns to and extremely well balanced and complex script to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better most anime is too confusing
