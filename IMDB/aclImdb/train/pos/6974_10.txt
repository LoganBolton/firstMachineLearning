i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica  being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe so i didnt know what to expectbut i did come out with a smile though i must admitbr br the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting charactersi wont give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch thisbr br must sayesai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adamafather of the admiral in battlestar galacticai found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsgbr br also eric stoltz fits his role precisely special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome dont sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch itwithout having to have see bsgbr br this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a scifi kick
