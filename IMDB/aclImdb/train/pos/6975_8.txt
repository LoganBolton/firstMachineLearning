if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10 i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better the production values are incredible and the acting is firstrate i dont mind that it doesnt seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and lets face it they are two different shows im thrilled that both esai morales and one of my alltime faves eric stoltz are back in my life if only weekly as ive missed them both this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray both literally and figuratively in plot lines characters and of course the various virtual worlds we all know how it ends but the journey is looking to be quite a ride
