im really addicted to caprica because its a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica it really has a slow pace start but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to airbr br i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first seasonbr br this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genresbr br eric stoltz does an amazing job as well as polly walker as clarice willowbr br totally worth checking outbr br catch caprica on fridays at 9pm8pm central on syfy
