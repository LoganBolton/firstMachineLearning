well i have to say that i have waited for it to comebr br i wont try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot on the other hand im not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilotbr br what the frack did they expect the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the cylons see the life of the adama family has we already knew some of it from bsg get a deeper explanation of the caprican population and its perception of the other colonies and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the cylons br br i do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will reinforce bsgbr br this is 1h30 of promising start i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot morebr br watching the dvds deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew onbr br looking forward to january 2010
