this is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on tv at the mobr br i was impressed right from the start dont be put off if your not a sci fi nut like me this could be happening on earth the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting there are no space ships or laser guns none yet anyway so far ive seen up to s01 e04 and im gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilitiesbr br the cast play there roles with pasion eric stoltz is especially strongbr br this show really stands alone well it doesnt matter if you watched bsg or not in fact they are quite different ive read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore thembr br this is a really positive start to a show lets hope they dont cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days
