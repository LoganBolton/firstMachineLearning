this is one of the first independent movies ive ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing br br well directed well acted of a subject that i havent seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended youll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldnt do the story better all in all 810
