to all the haters out there condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages that being said i was a huge fan of bsg thought it was some of the best tv drama not just scifi on the air but it was time for it to end and the story to move on i liked the bsg epilogue the plan but it raised as many new questions as it answered so i eagerly anticipated caprica and i was not disappointedbr br i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg and i was pleased that caprica is something different and i personally found the story exciting in a different way than blazing space battles explosions and scifi special effects dont get me wrong i like that stuff too eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances and alessandra was just wonderful i cant wait until next week
