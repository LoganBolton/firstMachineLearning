i loved it having been a fan of the original series i have always wondered what the back story would be  it didnt fail to delight me i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didnt recognise one person  this is refreshing much like bsg it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent  cant wait for the series to start airing well done to ronald d moore and team  excellent job the special effects dialogue and acting were all spot on and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the scifi stuff produced in the last decade
