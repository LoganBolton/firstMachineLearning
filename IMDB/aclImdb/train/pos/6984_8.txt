i was blown away by the reimagined battlestar galactica a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion a hardened scifi fan i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs and this was good stuffbr br as such when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica which wouldnt work at all bsgs story of a mournful ragged band of survivors trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudomiracles was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actorsbr br caprica feels different where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization caprica portrays that civilization in its cold and decadent heyday the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality in true bsg form caprica has in its first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom racism the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soulbr br the casting for caprica is also excellent each character is unique and deep from the obsessive and distant scientistturnedentrepreneur to his troubled and willful daughter each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective rolesbr br music which was used so powerfully in bsg also plays a significant role in caprica battlestars powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served its themes very well caprica uses a more orchestral sound which gives the show its own feeling quite distinct from either of its predecessors br br the new caprica is definitely its own show pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs i look forward to the full series
