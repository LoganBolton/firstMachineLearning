i have to say as a bsg fan i wasnt exactly sure what id think of this show i saw it on the big screen at the arclight cinema tonight as part of the paley center screenings and the cast and film makers spoke afterwards ron moore said they wanted to make a clean break from battlestar and do something different and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully theyd gain others br br even without their talk i am now a fan of the new show but heres what i thought of the filmbr br i loved it it was really very good i guess im a true scifi or syfy  do i really have to type that geek because id totally watch this as a series it has a strong and rich story and kept my interest br br it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing the actor playing ben should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs the actress playing zoe seemed a little posy but she was playing a teenager and im sure i wont be the only one who thought zoe was a cylon at first perils of being a bsg geek if theyre hoping these will be the new bamberhelferpark they may want to rethink it surprisingly it was the adults that captured the audiences attentionbr br eric stoltz gives a stellar performance as daniel greystone a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesnt let go he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his characters sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters traps her then dismisses and releases her no sign at all of the serial killer he played on grays anatomy really impressive actingbr br equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula malcomson as his wife amanda greystone she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as stoltzs part and i completely believed that they are a couple and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship something rarely seen these days i look forward to seeing what happens with this family and hope they give her as much to do as roslin in bsg she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid you cringe its really great not to mention her eyes which could hold magical powers thats how intense they are the scene where she takes on the government agent very short scene but beautifully played really gives you an idea of her powerbr br the other part of the show that did not work 100 for me were the scenes with esai morales and the mafia type clan of his he does a good job overall but i did not believe in this mobs power nor intimidated by their threats i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit but given time i can see how this will develop into an interesting upstairsdownstairs kind of thing with the poor minorities morales et al versus the rich folk who rule the planet stolz et al and to be honest i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name that was a very well played scenebr br note to bsg fans the boy playing willy adama doesnt really look much like olmos but hes just a kid whether or not hell be featured any more than he was in this film who knows i sure couldnt tell but it didnt bother me because he wasnt as interesting as everything else going on around himbr br polly walker plays sister clarice and shes chilling and odd in every scene shes in im not sure where shell go or who shell end up with but i was very impressed with her acting in this film she was sort of on the side but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on she was nothing like her character in rome something i always find impressive in actorsbr br one nice surprise the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg even though its the same guy doing it bear mccreary it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise id buy this score if i had the chancebr br as to the panel discussion after the show it was hosted by seth green ron moore was very smart and articulate david eick was cracking wise much like his video diaries esai morales told a long story about how he was cast and eric stoltz was very funny and didnt really answer the questions  but ive always had a thing for him paula malcomson was tough she took seth green to task for mistakenly saying she was on 24 and the girls who played zooey and lacey were both darling grace park and tricia helfer were there as well answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg overall a very interesting and wonderful eveningbr br im giving the show a 9 out of 10 and very much looking forward to watching it all unfoldbr br note i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the holoband was originally made for i have no idea what that may be but it holds a great deal of fascination to me
