i have seen this movie a while back after ordering it for my friend who is a big dominic monaghan fan the movie itself was very interesting though it had its positive points which for me was the donnie darko kind of wtf factor after the movie had endedbr br of course with positive also come negative points to me the young girl in the film was incredibly good and dominic monaghan did a good job as well unfortunately i dont have this opinion about daniel burke who played lonnie this might just be me and im not claiming to be a serious critic in the way that i dont find myself skilled enough but he just didnt seem convincing as an actor but perhaps its even more striking then for although i am not a critic this does get my attentionbr br to conclude over all i think its definitely a film worth watching its interesting confusing and you just should have seen it
