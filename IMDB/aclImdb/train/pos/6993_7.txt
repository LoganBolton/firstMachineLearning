this is not bela lagosis best movie but its got a good old style approach for some 40s horror entertainmentbr br brides are dropping dead at the altar like flies i think id postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught but its a horror movie so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason anyway lagosi is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to keep his aging sickly wife healthy and happy he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse and the brides just keep on getting zappedbr br no movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own good at solving crime bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim i love the haunted house bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosis sinister mansion hidden passageways a vampirelike wife an evil dwarf igor assistant and so on good stuffbr br fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner if you like old horror movies this one is worth a watch
