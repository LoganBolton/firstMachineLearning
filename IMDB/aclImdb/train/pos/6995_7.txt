rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist with yes a renfieldlike assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the scientists wife sounds like a greenaway movie actually lol lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides why them who knows so that his wife can keep looking beautiful he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar after another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop and decides to snoop around for a story she gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi heaven knows where the police were soon shes off to belas lair when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil it all cumulates in a totally farfetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has xray vision as he foils her plans oh no what will happen i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure lugosi is great here his hangerson are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable a fun little view
