i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start  every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtimebr br this movie could have been another easy slam dunk antigun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life  just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie this film not only doesnt follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to andor affect what happens afterwardsbr br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around antidepressant drugs more  the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues and for those who think certain things couldnt happen in a hospital i dont want to tell any particulars youre dead wrong on that too  ive been there the script was so real it was amazingbr br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before its too late someday theyll thank you for it
