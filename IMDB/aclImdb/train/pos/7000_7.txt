when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film  it clearly wasnt a reference to british currency so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh  taking them or giving them will smiths a feelgood actor so serial killers were out it could only be about a man giving them so must be about guilt somehow i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched as the beauty of the buildup is the way parts of the main characters background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doingbr br guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because its deeply uncomfortable and sad which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a rollercoaster ride  you know its going to be unpleasant i wouldnt say the movie glorifies suicide it delves into the most extreme form of selfsacrifice  martyrdombr br its also brimming with symbolism everywhere which is a surefire telltale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could determined to die but his plan is thwarted by falling in love  what a 2nd act complication absolutely masterfulbr br yes it is very slowpaced but im undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe i didnt feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have but maybe thats just me having ruined it for myself beforehand saying all that though it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thoughtprovoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get
