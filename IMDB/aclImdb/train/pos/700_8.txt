an insomniacs nightmare was an incredibly interesting wellmade film i loved the way it just throws you into the main characters subconscious without coddling the viewerthe acting was top notch  honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book  but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy ishotthisonmycamcorder look to them but this director knows what shes doing the lighting the cinematographyquality work im looking forward to a featurelength work from tess nanavati
