first i did like this film it was well acted by allbr br however i dont understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few gottasee recommendations but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes i wont mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others still despite it seeming obvious i kept watching it was nice to see how everything played out filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenesbr br i dont hate it when i guess the ending early in a film i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenerybr br will smiths screen persona is just likable even when hes playing such a troubled character hes energetic and believable in everything that ive seen him do seven pounds is another fine performancebr br rosario dawson is a solid performer portraying a quirky rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition beauty is in the eye of the beholder and with rosario if you dont find her gorgeous you should think about replacing your eyesbr br it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen i havent seen him much lately but that could just be me woody didnt have a tremendous amount of screen time but he sold his jolly pianoplaying blind man character for all it was worth excellentbr br a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plotbr br overall i have to recommend this film not for the plotting but for some very good performances and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid
