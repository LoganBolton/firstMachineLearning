featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist midsolo seven pounds races past the directors previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember gabriele muccinos name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isnt quite so highprofile br br too bad i figured out will smiths scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawsons character is introduced as having an incurable heartdiseasebr br however i still think the writerdirector made the right choice putting the bookends bookends are the first and the last scene in that way its the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smiths and dawsons character flourish and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky twobr br one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smiths character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when hes alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely its quite a versatile performancebr br lastly i cant forget to mention the crash scene reenactment which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list
