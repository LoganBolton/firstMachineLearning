although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie i still found it to be absolutely amazing it will touch you and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie or you just simply arent touched by anything it is worth seeing dont come into the movie expecting anything just have a box of tissues and an open mind it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant i think will smith despite that hes yet again playing another lonely depressed individual is amazing i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worstbest experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something and thats exactly what this movie does give it a chance
