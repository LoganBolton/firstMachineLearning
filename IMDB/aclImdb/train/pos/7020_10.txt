i mark where there are spoilers overall comments if you can take a serious movie go see this have an open mind and you will enjoy it dont leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on the movie fits together nicely in the second half i will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens br br i was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago when will was going around promoting the movie he was greatspent a lot of time with the fans thank you for the picture will about wills performance a lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movieshow you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance this is not the case with will smith in this movie i didnt picture the fresh prince lol when i was watching this movie he was completely and utterly convincing in this very very serious role he has grown immensely as an actor i think he will at least get an oscar nod for this performancebr br about his character ben is very conflicted and tormented hes sadguiltriddenvery determined but very scared very true to himself his character has a lot of depthand somehow will managed to bring that to lifebr br about emily rosario rosario did a nice job portraying emily a woman very much behind on her taxes maybe shes not the shining star will is in this movie but she was very convincing i think her character just did not have as much to work with as wills didbr br about the plot no spoilers i admit that i did not like the movie until the second half of it i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so but when things eventually fit together wow surprisingly well written and well thought out its an extremely intense movie that really sticks with youbr br it actually takes a lot out of you to watch in the theater i was in most people were crying towards the endeven grown men when you realize what ben is doing and why its a very powerful momentbr br  minor spoilers which is why its really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away i feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that i enjoyed though i will mention some of it here without trying to give a lot awaybr br the fish that ben was keeping in his hotel room at first it makes no sense whatsoever there was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fishbr br i hated ben at the beginning of the movie by the end of it i loved him and hated him thats how convincing will was i thought ben was being a huge jerk to ezra a blind man just trying to make his way in the world why he was treating ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie wait it out though everything in this movie wait it outbr br ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he wont forgive himself for its still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt or if he genuinely wanted to help people i think its a little bit of bothi think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past i love his character you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing you hate him because of what he is doing to himself as a very good person both physically and emotionally nice job will
