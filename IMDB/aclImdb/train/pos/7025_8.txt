i found this to be a charming adaptation very lively and full of fun with the exception of a couple of major errors the cast is wonderful i have to echo some of the earlier comments  chynna phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager at 27 shes just too old and yes it does show and lacks the singing chops for broadwaystyle music vanessa williams is a decentenough singer and for a nondancer shes adequate however she is not latina and her character definitely is shes also very strident throughout which gets tiresomebr br the girls of sweet apples conrad birdie fan club really sparkle  with special kudos to brigitta dau and chiara zanni i also enjoyed tyne dalys performance though im not generally a fan of her work finally the dancing shriners are a riot especially the dorky three in the barbr br the movie is suitable for the whole family and i highly recommend it
