bye bye birdie isnt one of the best musicals of all time but its great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this remake which aired on abc in 1995 is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this filmbr br jason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie  a role he played on the national tourbr br this film is not without its problems though a major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show withbr br but all in all this is a delightful welldone film which the material deserved
