this film is one of the best shorts ive ever seen  and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals ive seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best im not a fan of monaghan his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed this director really knows what shes doing of course you are going to get the trolls or just ignorant people who dont understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it but luckily from what ive seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gembr br lets not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because thats certainly true the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school pretend for a moment that the budget doesnt matter if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasnt the fault of the filmmaker i saw this at a festival and the sound was finei guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on minidv then what are you left with the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawlessbr br nanavati can tell a story that much is clear she can write substanceheavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards give it more experienced actors better sound postproduction and 35mm instead of minidv and even the trolls couldnt complain this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago shes done some amazing work since the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i cant wait to see the higher budget stuff shes done 910 stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker
