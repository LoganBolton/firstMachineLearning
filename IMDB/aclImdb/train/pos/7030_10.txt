we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release for it quickly became one of our family favorites the kids are now teens and must have seen it a bazillion times yet they still watch it religiously with friends its timeless appeal reaches across all ages groupssimilar to greasebr br vanessa williams is spectacular jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet ive noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him but our family gives him top ratings we loved his giant step number marc kudisch as conrad supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers and brigitta dau as ursula just flat steals the show probably our favorite character in the entire moviebr br the one disappointment was chynna philips performance of kim part of that has to do with the writing kims role is completely onedimensional complicating that philips delivery is flat unimaginative unbelievable and just plain awful the director should have seen that and corrected it or never cast her to begin withbr br overall though the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages
