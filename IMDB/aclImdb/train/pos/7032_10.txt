my schools drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002 and i can only hope were as good as this i watched this film recently as sort of research for my role rosie alvarez and id just like to say vanessa williams is the coolestbr br wow the casting for this movie was righton with one exception jason alexander oh my gawd is there anything he cant do he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever  i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during put on a happy face he is so great vanessa williams as i said before is the coolest she was a beautiful rosie and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable tyne daly was hilarious as alberts obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr mcafee however i loved paul lyndes performance in the 1963 version brigitta dau cracked me up as ursula merkle she really hammed it up and marc kudisch was an awesome conrad birdiesufferbr br there was only one casting that i didnt understand and as youll see from previous comments many other people didnt understand chynna phillips as kim mcafee  what was that i mean shes really pretty and very talented butshe looks a bit too old for the role eh maybe im delusionalbr br okay well anyways i highly recommend this movie itll leave you smilingbr br
