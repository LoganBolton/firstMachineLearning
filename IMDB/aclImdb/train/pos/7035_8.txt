cusack does his best david niven in this one although i dont know if anyone besides me noticed itbr br when seen with this in mind its a deliciously over saturated wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty dmn funny reworking of an underappreciated comedy classicbr br hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot  interesting choicebr br i never knew how soothing montels voice was until this movie i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs
