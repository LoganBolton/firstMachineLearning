got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date with an excellent performance for cusak tomei and all the supporting actorsbr br excellent plot very wellplaced and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed  choreographed very funnybr br all in all i give this film a big thumbs up its extremely critical of us military intervention in the middleeast and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who dont share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic
