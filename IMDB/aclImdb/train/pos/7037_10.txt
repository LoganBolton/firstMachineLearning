this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the us it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really isbr br another good film from this era rendition was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the us is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and maiming civilians in its quest for total world dominationbr br a clever plot good acting some big stars john cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans dont like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are complicit in mass murder
