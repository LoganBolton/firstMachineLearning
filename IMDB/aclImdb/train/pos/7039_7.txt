war inc is a funny but strange film the actors are likable the film is likable also but i dont know how to describe the plot i will go into the plot later on this is a movie with some weird casting choices besides john cusack as a hitman which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked br br here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that her character is odd there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants and hits on hausercusack there is a twist in the end involving the two characters it makes sensebr br that is the only casting choice i am going into cause it just plain strange the whole movie is strange but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored here we have some of the best actors out there excluding miss duff she aint great but here we have john cusack marisa tomeii joan cusack ben kingsley see what i meanbr br this is the story of a hitman named hausercusack he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriifnot the actor while trying to deal with his own personal problems he has to help out the wedding of a popstarplayed by hilary duff and he falls in love with a news reporterplayed by marisa tomeii there is a thing about the popstar though hauser is disgusted by her there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws upbr br the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming but that doesnt matter this is a strange funny and entertaining comedy i love most of the actors so really how could i not recommend itbr br warinc355
