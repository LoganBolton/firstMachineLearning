this movie was excellent for the following reasons 1 it contained great backdrops and sets 2 it showed the disparity of a wartorn environment alongside a technological one 3 john cusacks acting was terrific he portrayed angst very well 4 it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a wartorn situation 5 it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects i was also impressed with the acting for the most part hilarys acting was i found the most stilted the morals and values of everyone in a wartorn situation are up for grabs the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable great stuff psp
