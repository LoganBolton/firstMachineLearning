first someone mentioned here that because this was released in limited quantity it means that it should be badthat is exactly what the big five hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can pass or ignore features that are not desirable without loosing face or imagine by censoring them directly to the point this production has been released limited because is considered unpatriotic by certain individualsbr br now i absolutely loved this feature i find it way better then charlie wilsons war even if it is a fictional account of something that never happens but is always so obviousthis goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present american foreign policies home or aboard the turakistan country and the emerald city are definitely trying to resemble iraq and baghdad just as much as the corporation tamerlane goes for haliburton with the vice president dan aykroyd playing dick cheney lolthere are quiet a moments actually where the movie is dead serious not even sarcastic anymore main example would be as how john cusack character deals with his depression but not only br br i found that all the characters can be related to somethingsomeone or specific stereotypes now word of advise if you are not politically active especially towards the aspects of globalization  you will likely not enjoy this feature much since most of its content and inside jokes are targeting certain personalities that are not visibile to the general public on daily basesmain exception would be hilary duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star need i say names at its core the feature is an antiglobalization gig period the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance joan has a line at one point that goes like this and here we have a book written by you know who about how i conquered the world and resolved the issues with my dadpricelessbr br the sister and brother cusacks play good together as always same as in grosse pointeblank i would say a bit more maturemarisa tomeihere does not show her butt and breasts to impress us like she did recently in before the devil knows youre dead but instead she has a very serious role and manages to pull it off quiet wellbr br many critics dont get it can not do so or do not want to this is not a regular movie but more of a comic documentary this feature stands to deliver a message and not to get oscars or have visuals sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest hdtv experience tv setsi have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad reviews because is not artistic while pro iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being balanced apparently and engagingmakes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guysbr br i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north america as i mentioned before it is all a satire about american foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by special interests groups having the regular american soldier wearing the tamerlane corporate logo on its combat dress is pretty insulting but effective in showing reality as it is or will be soon the way things go so farbr br some priceless shots upon liberation the country gets invaded commercial advertisements a hilarious scene about how future journalists will likely gather newsanything is got to be better then this xbox bullocks soldiers dealing with their frustration br br overall i do not recommend this to conservatives or hard core patriots of some kind or anotherthis feature is not made to reach to the minds of souls of the peopleas mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do soinstead it contains a message well defined for realists and towards some ideological goals apparently always short of realizing
