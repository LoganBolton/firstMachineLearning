in war inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all warrelated activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq if you are familiar with the antics of halliburton kellogg brown  root and blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of cusacks latest piece cusack plays a corporate hitman named brand hauser who finds himself in turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target while there he finds himself intrigued by the antiestablishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the oversexualized pop star played by hilary duff we are introduced to hausers past which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named marsha dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him and played hilariously by joan cusack while some moments are played suitably over the top they arent always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise all the principals turn in solid performances duffs accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her disney image tomei is funny but understated while the cusacks own nearly every scene they are in to be fair they are given good material the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion in fact the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns its way to the expected conclusionbr br if you like your comedy broad and physical there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie on the other hand if you like sly comedy and broad satire this is for you
