this film needs to be seen the truest picture of what is going on in the world that ive seen since darwins nightmare go see it and if youre lucky enough to have it open in your city be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through though hardly perfect joan cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is good too its inspiring that john cusack got this movie made and i believe he had to use some of his own money to do it its a wild absurd ride obviously made without the resources it needed but still succeeds jon stewart steven colbert snl even bill maher havent shown the guts to say what this film says
