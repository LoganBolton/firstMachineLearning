the plot of this film might not be extraordinary but what makes the film really special are its characters and the actors who play them  of course i wont go into the details of the plot of the movie but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire if youre not alert even for a second youll probably end up missing one of the subtle points the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff  like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan the advertisements on the tankers which i almost missed and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughoutbr br coming to the actors john cusack has played his multifaceted role very efficiently what with him being the cowriter and the producer too and he plays his character  hauser the killer with a heart  exquisitely cusacks done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superbbr br however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff i have always been a huge fan of ms duff but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role shes playing in the movie but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor lets face it the kids growing but yes so is her talent all those critics who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act will be silent for a while hilary had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside yet a sweet child on the inside  and shes done complete justice to it she makes you laugh and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short cause i could go on raving about her for ever shes brilliant marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too especially joans hysterics are uproarious however i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lacklusterbr br in general war inc keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot i would highly recommend this movie to all and more so to hilary duff fans ps  i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon
