i dont want to spend to long here rambling about the plot youve seen the trailer and if you havent its online i dont recommend seeing it though it was poorly crafted and didnt pack any of the laughs or magic from the film so those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance its really funny i was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film the first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad austin powers film in the final 20 this however is one of the few films where the campy ending didnt make me dislike the rest of the film which is normally the case everyone gives a great performance especially joan cusack and there are some really great moments throughout i personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out only to catch all the details which i was laughing over during the first viewing
