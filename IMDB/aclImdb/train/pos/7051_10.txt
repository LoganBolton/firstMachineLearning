let me start by saying that war inc is not everyones cup of tea it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking  oh crap the comedy involved the film isnt obvious at all  its quite subtle tamerlane tanks drycleaning service etc and it changes with the twists  turns in the plotbr br i may be the only one but i wont compare this with grosse point blank because its different john cusack  i wouldnt say he was amazing or brilliant  but he was good on the other hand his sister joan cusack was incredible in her delivery of lines  comedic timing  even though she was hardly in the film id say the same about ben kingsleybr br marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to pull it off hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah duffs development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job even though her accent is a tad unrealbr br overall the film is what i would call entertaining it doesnt have a particular storyline and its quite silly at times but it does have a subtle message id say its worth a watch
