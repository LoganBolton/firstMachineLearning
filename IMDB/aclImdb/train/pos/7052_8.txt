joshua seftels first film  a satire of memorable proportions  is about just as the title suggests the corporations effect on warbr br the film is about a mercenary john cusack traveling to turaqistan not a real country fyi to help the american government get their message across to turaqistans leaders he meets a reporter marisa tomei and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man  a hot reporter somewhere in the mix a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in as yonica is marrying one of turaquistans most important people a son of the president a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star well somewhat the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar no more than fifteen seconds later the film hooks you with its amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics the films running time blows by you the film has a lot more action than i expected with the occasional scene of war well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder though the story isnt much deep the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alikebr br in the final act of the film the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled i thought it was executed very well but other may disagree and i could understand why twist after twist is what the ending is all about and like most films it is a true hitmiss situation regardless the three writers on the film mark leyner jeremy pikser  john cusack did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on todays situation overseasbr br joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the films integrity not reducing the material to the most redundant of films which i was afraid would happen seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could he created a vibrant atmosphere one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities  contrasting them perfectly  as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely no missteps here hopefully he takes on more directorial jobs for he is one director to look out for
