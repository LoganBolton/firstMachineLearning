dont mistake war inc for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs it isntbr br this is an oldfashioned screwball comedy with ridiculously coincidental plot twists stock characters given some depth in fun performances by john cusack joan cusack marisa tomei and hillary duff and a straightforward approach to the political contentbr br you see the filmmakers political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true yeah we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt inept pigs the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now  but none of that is the pointbr br here all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon  sometimes in genius ways  as the backdrop for a silly romp as john cusacks character the hitman with a heart tries to change his life with the help of the dogooder journalist who doesnt trust him tomei and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage duff cusacks sister joan plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia bossbr br thats all and it works its simple fun but if somehow you cant see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and theres no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs then you might not find it as funnybr br for all the rest of us it was a light comedy with a political edge
