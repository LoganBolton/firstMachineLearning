i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for though it has its confusing parts of the plot it doesnt greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie that being said if youre not open to more liberal political ideas then this probably isnt the movie for you i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area but thats intentionally done john cusack is right in that although its set in the future it really makes you see the present
