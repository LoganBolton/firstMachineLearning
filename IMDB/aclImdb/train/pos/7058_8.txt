just after i saw the movie the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the real magic in a moviebr br the combination of the right music speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body very special things i saw where the notknowing effects in the movie started with the disney logo transforming into the cinderella castle and ended as an oldstory telling fairytale with your grandparentsbr br the magic has returned in me i rate this movie 8 out of 10
