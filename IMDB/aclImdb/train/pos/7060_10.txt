many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first well maybe it isnt  to you however how does your child react to it well mine loved it more than the firstbr br disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids for example  bambis mother getting shot this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endingsbr br if you want to be snobby about what should be disneys standards based on the past  skip this movie br br if you have a sweet little girl or softhearted little boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your small children this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares im happy with a movie that pleases my kid  doesnt need to impress the parents all the time
