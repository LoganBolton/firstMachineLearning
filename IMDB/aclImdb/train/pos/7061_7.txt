of course the original is better but this isnt as bad as everyone says yes it is made up into 3 stories but hey so what i thought it was quite good to be honest i actually liked how anastasia changed a little when she fell in love it shows what love can do the stories were not so bad eitherbr br i liked cinderellas voice better in this too i have nothing against her voice in the original but i just think it sounds better here more nicer i liked her personality in this too she had more of a backbone yet she was still kindbr br so ill give cinderella iidreams come true a 710
