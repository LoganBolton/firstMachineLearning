im surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe pasternak if this film is any indication they were almost polar oppositesbr br while in three smart girls durbin plays an impulsive little miss fixit who after some setbacks manages to reunite her divorced parents in its semiremake three daring daughters jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him too from the durbin and powell films ive seen id say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performersbr br as for durbins performance in three smart girls i find it completely winning and most impressive although its clear from her occasionally shrill and overemphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna watching the selfconfident knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes youd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 yearold girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction br br given that this film and durbin herself were much publicized at the time as universals last chance the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age but youd never know it from the ease and assurance durbin displays on screen although shes clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like garland rooney oconnor and jane powell durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her and even here in her first film she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quicktempered impulsiveness of her character and though shes occasionally shrill she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her successbr br in short like all great singing stars durbin was much more than just a beautiful voice on the other hand while durbins pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument the most remarkable thing about it to me was the way she is able to project her songs without the slightest bit of affectation or grandnes that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like lily pons grace moore and jeanette macdonald in films of the periodbr br the film is also delightful heavily influenced by screwball comedy it backs durbin up with a cremedelacreme of firstclass screwball pros such as charles winninger binnie barnes alice brady ray milland and mischa auer the story is light and entertaining true its hardly realistic but why would anyone expect it to be if you want realistic rent the grapes of wrath or triumph of the will on the other hand if youre looking for a genuine sweet funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully charismatic and gifted adolescent lead and terrific supporting players this film wont let you down
