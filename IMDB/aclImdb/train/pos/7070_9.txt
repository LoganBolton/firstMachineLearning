one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the wellconcocted visuals the unsettling backdrops and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creators involvement instead of most movies where the filmmaker is some directorforhire that is paid to feature a star or two you can feel terry gilliams presence through the experience 12 monkeys is evidence of gilliams own vision and style as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake 12 monkeys is a variation on similar themes of gilliams repertoireoppressiverecessive societies the solitude of the protagonist the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel realms in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of arthouse pretentiousness the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliams choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the diseaseridden future world yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world the title itself is a mark of gilliams creativity as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood all in all gilliams dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience the film has immense rewatch value since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing definitely one of my favorites
