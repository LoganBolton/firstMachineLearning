one of the greatest film i have seen this yearlast maybe before sun rise which is also seen late at night alone in the lab i like the idea of the filmwhich suggest free will of man and our weakness against fatewith time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes i do like the end but a big question also comes the virus shall not be released again should itbr br in the last scene in the airport jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr goines assistant so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virusjames keep an eye on him at the time remember and he has teeth so why everything is still happen why future scientists dont do anything after the truth is revealed my biggest question after the film
