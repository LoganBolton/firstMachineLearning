terry gilliam traveled again to the future he had already done it in brazil to tell this story about a virus thats destroying the human racebr br the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but its quite entertaining and gilliam proves that hes got imagination the futuristic scenes are just great as for the cast bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe whatever happened to her are just ok but brad pitt is so annoying whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and hes not credible at all he should just play goodlooking successful young menbr br my rate 710
