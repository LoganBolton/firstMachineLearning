time paradoxes are the devils snare for underemployed minds theyre fun to consider in a what if sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including star trek first contact the back to the future trilogy bill and teds excellent adventure groundhog day and the stargate sg1 homage window of opportunity heinleins all you zombies was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first timebr br in the case of terry gilliams excellent film 12 monkeys its hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us rethink our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mindbr br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as the continual wrenching of experience visited upon him by time travelbr br unlike other time travel stories 12 monkeys is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal timelinebr br even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single timeline universe in order to ensure that the timeline is not alteredcole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized if thats the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too muchbr br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past eventsor does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
