one of the alltime great science fiction works as visionary and thoughtprovoking as blade runner or even gilliams own brazil willis gives his best performance here but hes outdone by pitts incredibly frenetic turn thats unlike anything hes done before or since even stowe isnt out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten
