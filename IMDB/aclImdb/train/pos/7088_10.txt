terry gilliams and david peoples teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the 90s peoples proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  i especially love the idea one cant change the past its a nice counterpoint to so many timetravelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originalitybr br the story itself is engaging one man james cole played by bruce willis in a heartwarming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus thats wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information hell collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their timetravelling technology isnt perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists end of the millennium paranoia biological weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess but instead twelve monkeys is a thoughtprovoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideasbr br i watched this movie once around 10 years ago it marked me a lot i remember still thinking about many days afterwards for my young mind this seemed quite mindblowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important ive rewatched this movie a few days ago on dvd and its better than i remembered it brad pitt still steals all the scenes hes in playing jeffrey goines  almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club  a rich kid with some anarchistnonconformist ideas whos also crazy and according to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie pitts eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you hes really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands pitts oscar nomination was well deserved surprising was also bruce willis performance his i didnt remember very well but its beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past youll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character peoples tried to imbue some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked ironically cole didnt start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world hes considered mad and convinced its all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he cant distinguish past from future reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when coles shrink dr kathryn railly finds undeniable proof hes really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also wellhanded although perhaps a bit compressed for times sake but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragicbittersweet climax at an airport wrapping all the pieces together which will blow many minds awaybr br there are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole whos just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole whos witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe is very good playing dr railly she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past cant be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of chinatown in that sense the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help raillys character shares that fatalism the more she tries to help cole  first dealing with his madness then helping him in his mission  the more theyre sucked into tragedybr br the twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling coles mission hasnt been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained its not supposed to be art although its more artists than many artistic movies its an unpretentious movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece
