a linear travel within a nonlinear structure its a fact that time in 12 monkeys flows in this comeandgo between present future and past however the movies linearity cant be avoided its the very work of the projector the unfolding of the narrativebr br what we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions the world of this terry gilliam film is a world with little space for freewillbr br right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenics prophecy according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997 forcing the few survivors to live underground  the only place not affected by the virusbr br coles willis mission is clear return to the mid 90s to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus theres no way to change the past all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present that for us viewers is the future find the cure not to change what happened the past is inevitable but make the present betterbr br in his returns in time cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma his life in the past is better than his life in the presentbr br the latter is dark and dehumanizing controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect volunteers this word is incisively ironic to embark on the journeys to the pastbr br the scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel and cole ends up on wrong dates  this will later in the plot work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist kathryn stowebr br we can see through the evolution of the story that linearity and nonlinearity interlace in a circular temporalitybr br there is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last  and certainly the climactic  appears it modifies itself according to the evocation of coles memories that come up in his dreamsbr br in an airport a man is shot dead while running armed toward someone else a blonde woman runs after the murdered onebr br this is the scene that connects the past in which cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents the present the time of the narrative and the future adult cole throughout the narrative cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now his prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened the agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist doctor peters morse that is the responsible for the dissemination of the diseasebr br what was cant be changed and in coles case what was is what will be eternallybr br a film not quite well understood for many to me nothing less than a masterpiecebr br other good movies with similar theme the back to the future trilogy that has another angle regarding the mad scientist character and although it shares the atmosphere of decay  particularly in the second film  it is way more optimistic than gilliams work that is an odd hollywood picturebr br in another register there is wild strawberries one of bergmans masterpieces that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscencesbr br ive never watched la jet√©e but only because i cant find it
