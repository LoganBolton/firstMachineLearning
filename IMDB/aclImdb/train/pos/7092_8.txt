there is a story possibly apocryphal about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys gilliam allegedly produced a long list think about the aircraft one from the fifth element and handed it to butch bruce it was entitled things bruce willis does when he acts it ended with a simple message saying please dont do any of the above in my moviebr br there is a fact about this movie definitely true gilliam didnt have a hand in the writingbr br i would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary if not commercial success that is the twelve monkeysbr br visually the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general but magnificent strangeness gilliam delights in wrongfooting his audience although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real gilliam borrows heavily from kafka in the clockwork bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate it is this journey and the character developments they undergo which unsettlesbr br i love gilliam films brazil in particular but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness he seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess brazil in particular i still maintain that brazil is gilliams tour de force but theres no denying that the twelve monkeys is a breath of fresh air in the tightplotting department style substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the expythonbr br whatever the truth of the rumour above gilliam also manages to get a first rate and very atypical performance out of the bald one bruce is excellent in this film as are all the cast particularly a suitably bonkers  and very scary  brad pittbr br its been over a decade since this film was released when i watched it again i realised that it hadnt really aged i had changed of course and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that partly at least is about reflections in mirrors altered perspectives and the absurd oneway journey through time that we all make a first rate film 810
