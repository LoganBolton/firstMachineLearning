with twelve monkeys you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey goines brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn railly madeleine stowe who doesnt believe him in 1990 when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996 kathryn starts believing coles storiesbr br the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you cant have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the moviebr br twelve monkeys works as scifi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me
