i saw his movie in dallas texas when it came out in 1986 i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie after seeing the movie i can see why the movie was not bad nor was it great the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story they created a new story new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue as a kid i loved the movie but unfortunately i havent seen it as an adult and cant give a better review looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and reevaluate my stance on it that being said will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge i love robotech and cant wait for the shadows chronicles
