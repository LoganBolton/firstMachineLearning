other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film thats simply not true and a little unfairbr br the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity i dont think theres anything wrong with the tarantinoesquire way of interlocking stories together perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try i thought it made the film much more interesting perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening but thats about the only fault i can find nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone
