while i dont agree with bobs and tammys decision to give up baby jesse and its something id never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects patty duke antagonist almost unheard of as far as im concerned but during the movie she really convinces you that shes psychotic or at least that theres something seriously wrong with her her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think its not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute thatll make you laugh but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from others perspectives and discover a little something about yourself caution you may even grow while watching this movie and its all worth it in the end
