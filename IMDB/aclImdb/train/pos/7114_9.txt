definitely at the top five of best john garfield movies has to be pride of the marines its the true story of marine private al schmid who at the cost of his own sight while wounded held off a horde of storming japanese on guadalcanal br br the story nicely segments in three parts al schmids home life where hes a simple working stiff whos just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night pearl harbor is bombed and hes off to war as millions of others werebr br the second part is at guadalcanal and we see part of the action where hes in an isolated machine gun nest holding off japanese troops his action prevented marine positions from being overrun but a grenade does in his eyesightbr br and of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people arent just caring for him out of pity most of all that girl he was seeing eleanor parkerbr br this film was broadcast on tcm on john garfields 95th birthday and there was a documentary on garfield hosted by his daughter one of the people interviewed said that garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card br br in that respect he was lucky in that he did land with warner brothers in hollywood though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background because he came from the kind of life al schmid had with the exception of garfields jewish backgroundbr br in that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like al schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country no super heroics here just a guy whod rather have been back in philadelphia but doing a job that had to be donebr br its a great part for garfield its a film one shouldnt miss i do wonder though whatever happened to the real al schmid
