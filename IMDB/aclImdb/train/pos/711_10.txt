rock n roll high school will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal mary woronov of eating raoul fame the whole movie is a mile a minute its basically a big excuse to have fun and im sure that you will bullied freshmen check a dorky music teacher paul bartel also from eating raoul check exploding mice checkmatebr br anyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living even for someone like me who doesnt know the ramones music its pure pleasure with roger corman executive producing and joe dante codirecting how could we expect anything less too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as caddyshack iibr br also starring pj soles vincent van patten clint howard dey young dick miller who has appeared in every one of joe dantes movies and many of roger cormans don steele and of course the ramones a real treatbr br it seems like bartel and woronov always costarred they also costarred in joe dantes hollywood boulevard and the slasher flick chopping mall also starring dick millerin which they reprised their roles from eating raoul
