i hadnt seen this film in probably 35 years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i didnt miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again i found the visual images from the pride of the marines were as vivid and effective as i first remembered what makes this movie so special anywaybr br everything based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crews ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november 1942 the screenplay stays 95 true to the book upon which it was based al schmid marine by roger butterfield varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture this is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film but it is a memorable 10 minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre in a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war this film isnt about glorifying war i cant imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service not right away anywaybr br what this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to reclaim their lives theres an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and i feel thats another reason why the film was so so well receivedit was exceptionally wellwritten theres a dream sequence done in inverse negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by john garfield garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmids were nearly the same and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role actors dont do that much anymore but added to the equation its just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story
