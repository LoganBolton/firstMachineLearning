marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england what makes this film so good is the touching of the human elementthis film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as mrs miniver and hope and glory as is the case with this film we see the desperation of people in the time of warbr br the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombingbr br we soon see why this child wets his bed he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terriblybr br the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life when the child is returned to his mother the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boys homebr br the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships
