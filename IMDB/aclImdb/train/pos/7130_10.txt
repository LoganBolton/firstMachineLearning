well when before i saw this film i really wasnt sure whether it would be my cup of teahow wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films ive watched for a very long time a real family classic the story of a young evacuee and his new foster dad this film ticks all the boxes ive not read the book maybe thats a good thing  meant i enjoyed the film more but with regards to the story i really cant think of any bad points hence scoring it 10 out of 10 and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks by the time william proclaimed i can ride my bike dad i was sobbing my heart out anyone whos seen it will understand im sure really heartwarming and definitely recommended
