absolute masterpiece of a film goodnight mrtom has swiftly become one of my favourite films of all time nobody should miss out on seeing this film its just too good mrtom is perfectly portrayed by john thaw as the harsh old man who becomes a soft fatherfigure when william beechnick robinson is sent to him for evacuation almost like the town mouse and the country mouse a truly heart wrenching film the director knew exactly how to turn book into film and he has done so extremely well the film was so excellently shot that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a range of emotions from love to fear and these emotions could turn on a sixpence set in a time of turmoil during world war two this film also shows the difference between the cities and the countryside they are almost like different countries an absolute must see those who dont are missing out on a truly amazing and brilliant film
