this has to be one of the most beautiful moving thought provoking films around its good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved every time i see the ghost of zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end i cant help but cry my eyes out john thaws performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us gone but not forgotten a outstanding film full marks
