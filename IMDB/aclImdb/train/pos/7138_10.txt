if john thaw had never played morse kavanagh or starred in the sweeney and other productions hed be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in goodnight mr tombr br superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his costar young nick robinson in his first role and an unobtrusive cast this adaptation of michelle magorians charming novel is a fitting memorial to his artbr br when i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz i found a rather obvious timeline error in it and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error they also must be applauded for not oversentimentalising the tale and preventing what could have been turned quite easily into a mushy messbr br if you keep a cd or video library then this feelgood made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion
