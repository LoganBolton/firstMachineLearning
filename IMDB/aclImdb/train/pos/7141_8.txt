since siskels death and eberts absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesnt like personally ie films with country music get panned because i dont like country music and childrens movies get a standard dont see it now wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids roeper may well be an idiot savant but in some other field the weekly guests sittingin for ebert fare better but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat all that said it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching as for roger ebert if stephen hawking can talk so can you its your mind and thoughts we long for do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his selfdeclared throne
