holes originally a novel by louis sachar was successfully transformed into an entertaining and wellmade film starring sigourney weaver as the warden shia labeouf as stanley and khleo thomas as zero the roles were very well casted and the actors portrayed their roles wellbr br the film had interweaving storylines that all led up to the end the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie the third is about elya yelnats and madame zeroni which explains the 100year curse on the yelnats family in my opinion these storylines were weaved together very wellbr br contrary to many peoples beliefs i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie the film is reasonably easy to understandbr br the acting in the film was well done especially shia labeouf stanley khleo thomas zero sigourney weaver the warden and jon voight mr sir the other members of dtent jake smith squid max kasch zigzag miguel castro magnet byron cotton armpit and brenden jefferson xray enhanced the comic relief of the movie however the best parts were with zero and stanley who made a great team togetherbr br although holes is a disney movie it deals with some serious issues such as racism shootings and violence the films dramatization at some points is very well donebr br i would suggest this movie to people of all ages whether they have read the book or not you shouldnt miss it
