i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long it brings out the child in everyone i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment louis sachar thats who although the movie was different from the book it was still very good for example cavemanstanley was supposed to be the biggest one there weight wise and height wise but zigzagricky was taller and armpittheodore was bigger also xrayrex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasnt the only thing that i didnt like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion i especially like the work of the boys though like squidalan who was played by jake msmith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid jake msmith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or youll be missing out on a whole lotta fun
