what a great movie this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60s and the 70s i was so pleasantly surprised after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disneys live productions crews have churned outbr br this movie is an absolute joy the child stars were just that professional quality actors i am most impressed with the quality of this moviebr br sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic insert hyperbole here running a prison camp for wayward boys siobhan fallon was wonderful as the stars motherbr br i wont recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb this work reminds you what its like to be a child without going all sugary or being too grim the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it while the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent it was best that waybr br this was an absolutely delightful movie to watchbr br it gets a 910 frombr br the fiend
