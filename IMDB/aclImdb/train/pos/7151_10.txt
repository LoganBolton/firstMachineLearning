i read holes in 5th grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic of course being my busy self i didnt get chance to see the movie in theaters holes was at the drivein just out of town but alas we were just too busy i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me they all said it was good but ive read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worriedbr br suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit my sister who is 9 and i watched it and absolutely loved it i then took it to the other people i was babysittings house and their kids 9 and 4 liked it too even my parents loved it and theyre deffinately movie critics overall i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast this movie should be on your top 5 to see list
