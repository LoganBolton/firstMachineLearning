my wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story having read it to several of her classes it never sounded all that interesting to me though and i bought the dvd figuring this would be a movie that wouldnt really be up my alleybr br the first half of the movie has a lot of setup and i found myself thinking that i was right it starts off a bit slow and i have to admit that i was a little bit bored  but curious enough to stay with it boy am i glad i did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie i would most certainly watch this againbr br the casting was very good since i havent read the book i cant vouch for accuracy but i have to say that jon voight was truly delightful you liked the characters you were supposed to like hated the ones you were supposed to hate and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funnybr br i can see how some folks might not like this movie it is tedious at times especially in the beginning all the flashbacks can be distracting though they are essential to the story once the story starts to come together at the end though i think youre paid back in spades for your patience when all is said and done i think this is a very good movie  810br br
