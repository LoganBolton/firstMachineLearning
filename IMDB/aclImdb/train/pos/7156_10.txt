holes is an awesome movie i love it a lot and its one of my favorite films its one of the few flicks produced by disney that isnt cheesy holes is generally a very cool motion picture i wish disney would make more pictures like it holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool dont get the wrong idea i dont mean to bad mouth disney but most of its stuff is aimed towards kids and thats okay children deserve to have their entertainment too but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with holes its the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think its corny really its the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate tobr br holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this
