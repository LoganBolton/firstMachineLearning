louis sachars compelling childrens classic is about as disney as freddy krueger its got murder racism facial disfigurement and killer lizardsbr br tightly plotted its a multilayered interlinking story that spans history to reveal stanleys own heritage and the secret behind the holes it races from latvias lush greenness to the pockmarked camp green lake hint theres no lake and no greenbr br disneys first success is recreating the novels environments so convincingly  the set design is superb and without gloss the other plus is in the casting rising star shia labeouf charlies angels 2 project greenlight might not be the fat boy of the book but his attitude is right and hes far from the usual cleancut hero the rest of the cast is filled out equally well from patricia arquette as the frontier school marmturnedbank robber to henry winkler as stanleys dad the downside is the pop soundtrack  pure marketing department  and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end
