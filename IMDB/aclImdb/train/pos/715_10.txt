all the folks who sit here and say that this movies weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddyo ms trogar exploding white mice the hall patrolsinstant classics nevermind the riff randell characterbr br if you dont like the ramones then you dont know rock and roll and you dont deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school
