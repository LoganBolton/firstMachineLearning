huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classicbr br its immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80s infinitely better than the american pies that plague us nowbr br there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of 84 three oclock high and the cheesy yet grippingdoesnt seem possible rivers edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because its the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with itbr br i love you riff randellbr br 1010
