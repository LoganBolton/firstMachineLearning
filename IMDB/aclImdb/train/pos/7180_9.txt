twisted bizarre enchanting and hilarious i couldnt stop laughing watching this film darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980s its an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera manipulation is a strong word however dont we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another br br from the beginning i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible later darren comments about his budding homosexuality and you can see it from the hints big hints of flamboyance at an early age maybe it was just the warm southern california weather who knows as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment its great to see that his parents supported and loved him and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lensbr br put the camera on me offers a look back to the 80s untouched by commercialism youll remember the hair the music and the fashions im the same age as mr stein so the trip back to memory lane was welcome his solo lipsyncing dance number is priceless enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood tshirtbr br the films deal with dark themes at time child abuse the holocaust nuclear war sexual fantasy and social dysfunction no childhood is completely carefree and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least and hilarious to beholdbr br watch at your earliest convenience
