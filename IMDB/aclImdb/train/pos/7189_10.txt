my very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villains cant tell who is under that cloth then they are daftbr br but in reed hadleys zorros fighting legion serial 1939 the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really isbr br but anyway zorro is one of the best characters in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in the mask of zorro 1998 is a delightbr br my interest in films is vast but l have a real liking for the serials of the 30s40sbr br bond2a
