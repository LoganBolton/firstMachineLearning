reed hadley makes a better foppish don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro but thats almost beside the point because this serial features the barnone best theme song of any serial ever  and the best version of yakima canutts famous stagecoach stunt there are other good stunts and lots of action and plenty of hairraising cliffhanger chapter endings but if for no other reason you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt then rewatch it in slow motion it is incredible and despite the lower budget for this chapter play yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film stagecoach indiana jones eat your heart out this is the real deal
