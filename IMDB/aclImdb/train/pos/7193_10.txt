god zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan and probably had about as many actors in the title role br br this serial is one of my own personal favourites and as previously statedit is one of the top 5 sound serials oddly enough this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 by the time of this production in 39 zorro was really well known as a pulp literary and movie character the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the mexicos struggle for freedom from rule by a european monarchy namely spain the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary warbr br the story concentrates its attention to the mythical province of san mendelito and its council it is being addressed by benito juarezon their gold mines relation to the new republic of mexico gold shipments must get thru to mexico citybr br don francisco uncle to diego vega states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoysa thug from the don del oro mob stages an insult to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords don frasncisco getting run throughbr br suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark z on the face of the bad guy he dispatches him to the hereafter don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward ramon william corson that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del oro but expires before completing statementbr br there is a big reception for diego at don franciscos hacienda where diego disappoints ramonsister also ward of don francisco with his timid act a fop she declaresbr br laterdiego and ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers when they ask who will lead us with don francisco now dead ramon declares zorro we are zorros fighting legion well there is a big battle with the legion now all clad on gray with masks and capes protecting the gold train then zorro seems trapped at a manmade avalanche intended for the convoy when well you know cliffhanger end of chapter onebr br wow that was a lot of writing for one chapter but like most other serials the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line lets just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good well made action filled chapters followingbr br zorros fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action we have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of don del oro we had soldiers renegade whites hostile indians and the legionbr br in short its safe to say that there is everything one could want and then some in this serial and incidentally they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accentsbr br as to just what is there here that makes zfl stand out from the rest what makes it different or unique wellbr br first of all it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one this is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound trackbr br and yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others that is the film not only has a heroic musical theme but it also sports lyrics yes the legionairres sing we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewingbr br when the serial was first shown on our local television circa 1955 all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as belonging to captain braddock from racket squad the tv series mr hadley had a very distinctive deep voice he also handled the role very well his costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functionalbr br there is a small slip up a sort of minor anachronism occurs by having benito juarezcarleton youngaddressing the san mendelito council as juarez was about 18 years old at this time 1824 and though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in mexicos history he surely hadnt achieved such prominence yet his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner brothers juarez that year which starred paul muni in the title rolebr br this is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial but also my favourite zorro filmbr br  we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year what with gone with the wind mrsmith goes to washington the citadel juarez the wizard of oz of mice and men one million bczenobia we want our mummy all counted among the output that yearbr br  once again juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 about 25 years later also the political subdivisions are referred to as provinces in the story in actuality they are called states just as we are called the united states of america so toosouth of the border they call their repubhlic the united states of mexicobr br  reed hadley was prominent in some very a pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect watch  listen for his narration in the house on 92nd street 1945 and guadalcanal diary 1945
