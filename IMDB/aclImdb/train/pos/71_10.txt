i couldnt believe the comments made about the moviebr br as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i didbr br what i viewed was incredible i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the moviebr br i hadnt had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldnt have been more set back by the incredible job that they did id have to say its the most believable movie that ive seen in a long time br br what i dont see is why everyone has such a problem with deannas choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice that i dont understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great rolesbr br busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her you go girl
