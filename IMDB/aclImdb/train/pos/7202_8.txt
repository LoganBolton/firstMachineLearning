long before brokeback mountain about 23 years before deathtrap was the first time i ever saw two men passionately kissing on screen and frankly i was shocked i understood it in terms of the plot and it didnt really upset my sensibilities not much but it was the first time i ever saw it at least in a mainstream movie i thought it was a gutsy move for its time and took courage for them to try it especially christopher reeve in the midst of his time as pgrated superman male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with brokeback but its interesting to note this muchearlier incarnation
