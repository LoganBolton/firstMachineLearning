excellent plot within a plot within a plot shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog must be my upbringingbr br very well acted by all you never quite know whos going to outdo who the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just desertsbr br recommend to all a harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael caines overuse of the word bloody but thats his signature isnt itbr br 910
