playwright sidney bruhl a wonderfully overthetop michael caine would kill for a hit play enter young wonder kid a solid reeve whos just written such a play weave into this bruhls overly hysterical wife superbly played by cannon and a german psychic a very funny irene worth and youve got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flickbr br while not up to sleuth standards deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira levin the performers are obviously having a field day with the material with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gustobr br the film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun
