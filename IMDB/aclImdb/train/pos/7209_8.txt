ive bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasnt an option a certain company i wont identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds clean and sober star 80 and this one to name just three of films i dont think anyone wants to see in this compromised format some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 1661 ratiobr br that off my chest ill say deathtrap was a spooky and oddly enough amusing picture my only complaints are the tinny score what is that fg instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals couldnt her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed minor complaints both the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you dont likebr br i never saw a staged version of deathtrap so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg the theatre was more affordable to average people now anyone paying less than a kings ransom to get live entertainment probably isnt going to a hit show on the great hyped waybr br michael caine and christopher reeve were both large virile specimens in the early 80s and thats integral to how well react to their profession and overall image here theyre definitely not bookish men who cant fight or will back down from an obstacle the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate deathtrap
