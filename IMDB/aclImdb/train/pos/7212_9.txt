i would not hesitate to put this adaptation of death trap in a top 5 list of the best stagetomovie adaptations ever caine and reeves an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and superman play off each other extremely well here even dyan cannon  who i normally dont care for  is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actressbr br im not sure that comparisons of deathtrap with sleuth  another brilliant stagetoscreen adaptation featuring michael caine  are valid or even fair yes the two stories have a lot in common but sleuth is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits and the house in sleuth is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors  the house doesnt really have an equivalent in deathtrap and deathtrap isnt so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good and never as smart as they think they are and deserve everything they get ill just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre and well worth your time and money this is america after all you dont have to choose br br i wont give away the twists and turns of the plot but i dont think it matters anyway ive watched the dvd eight or nine times in a dozen years and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean scary moments when things go all pear shaped its all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destinationbr br anyone who likes blackhearted comedy and suspense in the hitchcock style of filmmaking will probably enjoy deathtrap immensely
