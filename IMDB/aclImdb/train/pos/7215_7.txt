full of spoilersbr br this is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on ira levins play about two gay playwrights caine and reeve that plot the murder of ones rich wife cannon to get the property and the insurance the plot succeeds but christopher reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder  with only slight changes in the details reeve allows that easthampton long island can become southampton long island in the script for instance the rest of the plays plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth reeve doesnt mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into cannons apparently accidental death it will boost the revenues and his own warhol quotientbr br michael caine is sidney bruhl the megabucksmaking playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play perhaps with reeves input that would redeem his reputation he cannot permit reeves scandalous playaclef to be produced so  what else  he tries to murder him in the end they wind up killing one another the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor the psychic helga tensdoorp and she makes a million bucks selling it to broadwaybr br its a lot of fun for a number of reasons one is the production design that multiroomed multistoried house with the big windmill atop situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth easthampton would be a splendid set of digs anywhere you wouldnt be able to afford a pup tent in easthamptom the house is not overly large or baroque in its decor its just magnificently modest although its a little tidy for my tastes the kind of house thats so clean youre afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a footbr br next the acting could hardly be improved upon caine cannon and fred jones are superb dyan cannon gives a pitchperfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if theyd been sprayed on which is okay given her assets even reeve whose talent was limited seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer irene worth as the psychic neighbor helga was in some way hard to define a mistake granted she  or someone like her  was necessary to the plot but my god what an offensive snoop her character is going around and claiming i feel pain in zis woom i suppose in order to make her a little more interesting shes got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it still shes a nuisance from beginning to endbr br you have to love ira levins bitchy dialog the distraught caine begs reeve to tell him why he wrote the tellall play because its there sidney says reeve and caine shouts thats mountains not plays plays arent there until some hole writes them great too is caines call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright as planned he works himself up into a torrent of sobs barely able to speak as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately when he hangs up his face assumes its usual placid expression he blows his nose into his handkerchief and walks away all business againbr br the climax though suitably ironic is confusing and noisy and full of artifice lacking in the wicked charm that levin and lumet brought to the earlier scenes the score is mostly made up of lighthearted riffs on the harpsichord neatly fitting into the filmbr br youll probably enjoy it
