rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones i was too young during the bands mid70s heyday to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it isnt it every high school kids dream to trash his school and blow it up all set to a rockin soundtrack i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass i have to check out some of their albums the rest is history twenty years umpteen ramones lpscassettescds and three ramones shows later theyre still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it now that joey dee dee and johnny have left us rip allat least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by
