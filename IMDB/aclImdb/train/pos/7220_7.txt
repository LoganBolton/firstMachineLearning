nothings more enjoyable for me than a whodunit or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end and thats precisely what happens in deathtrap based on a chilling play by ira levin rosemarys babybr br and in it michael caine and christopher reeve get to do the kind of stunt that caine and laurence olivier pulled off in sleuthwith just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever playbr br but because its meant to scare you surprise you and keep you guessing as to the outcome its difficult to write a review about the plot lets just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present michael caine is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably when a young aspiring writer christopher reeve sends him the manuscript of his play caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation backbr br from that point on its a matter of fun and games for the audience as ira levins story unwinds managing to trump agatha christie for the number of twistsbr br caine and reeve play off each other brilliantly each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humorbr br summing up well worth seeingbut not everyone is pleased with the ending
