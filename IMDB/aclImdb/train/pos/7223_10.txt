the comparison to sleuth the earlier stageplayturnedfilm is obvious and upon my first viewing i too thought sleuth was better but deathtrap has at least for me many more repeat viewings in it than sleuthbr br i purchased deathrap in the bargain bin at walmart figuring that it had caine and the underrated reeve and was worth the 6 bucks it was one of the finest dvd purchases i couldve picked upbr br its one of those bestkeptsecrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover and its totally worth repeat viewingsbr br though laurence olivier and michael caine turned in bravado performances in sleuth i was doubly impressed with christopher reeve as clifford anderson reeve rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of superman stole the show in what shouldve been an oscar worthy performance ive always felt reeve was a typecast actor who didnt get much of a chance to shine outside of the superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like somewhere in time but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use thank goodnessbr br i absolutely relished michael caines performance he was glib deliciously manipulative and sadistic and watching him work with reeve and dyan cannon was an absolute pleasure in fact it was thanks to this movie that i got into a michael caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible br br as for deathtrap theres enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its memorable quotes section unfortunately much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plotbr br its really really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own needless to say its a mustsee but for me it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all timebr br repeat viewings are a must br br and it deserves to sit alongside sleuth on your dvd shelfbr br ill leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film i wonder if it wouldnt bewelljust a trifle starryeyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaborationwhere i could count on no sense of moral obligationwhatsoever
