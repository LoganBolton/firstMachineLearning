when deathtrap was first released the posterreproduced on the cover of this dvdoffered a graphic akin to a rubiks cube it is an appropriate image originally written for the stage by ira levin who authored such memorable works as rosemarys baby and the stepford wives the play was one of broadways most famous twisters and under sidney lumets direction it translates to the screen extremely wellbr br deathtrap is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous but the opening premise is extremely clever sidney bruhl michael caine is the famous author of mystery plays but these days he seems to have lost his touch after a particularly brutal opening night an old student named clifford anderson christopher reeve sends him a script for a play he has written it is called deathtrap and sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit just the sort of hit that would revive his career indeed a hit to die for and when clifford visits to discuss the play events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possiblebr br like anthony shaffers equally twisty sleuth deathtrap is really a story more at home on the stage than the screento reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers still under the expert guidance of director sidney lumet it makes a morethanrespectable showing on the screen much of this is due to the cast which is remarkably fine michael caine gives a truly brilliant performance dyan cannon is funny and endearing as sidneys relentlessly anxious wife and christopher reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career if you cant see it in a firstrate theatrical production this will more than do until one comes alongbr br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
