the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter otooles performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than otoole i dont think so what a great face that man hasbr br the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter otooles luminous performance and im sure i wouldnt have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadnt been in it
