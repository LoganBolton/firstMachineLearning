the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom  jerrys cartoon it features the usual catmouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse himbr br as much as it is weird its also very cool and funny to see what we cant see jerry invisible its amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing whos doing it we know who right  its like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts its equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while hes invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when hes not visiblebr br some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerrys shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks toms chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his facebr br overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too
