i havent read through all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged im curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didnt make much sense to me even when i rewatched them 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also poor little rich girl which was tourneurs next film is 65 minutes long and pride of the clan which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long so im relieved to see that i wasnt crazy there must be part of this film missing and thats why the resolution didnt make much sensebr br its hard to review or comment on a movie that youre only able to see half of but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an east coast movie studio of the time its the earliest film ive personally seen thats based on the movie industry itself the main character is a movie star played by robert warwick who was later a mainstay hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston sturges films he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on william s hart who warwick does resemble somewhat after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl doris kenyon and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have nowbr br again id recommend it to anyone whos interested in film history for the documentary value but in the form we have it doesnt hold up much as a movie and isnt a particularly good example of maurice tourneurs work
