having previously seen the abridged print presented by david shepard i finally got a hold of a completeor nearer complete version which was about 56 minutes compared to the 30minute version more widely distributed the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality and the best parts are there but its nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story endsbr br in the shepard print the film ends with mary stating you see ive changed my mindim never going home yet in the complete version mary and kenneth driscoll end their relationship soon after that scene  mary returns home to the country  and driscoll rekindles his relationship with vivian this additional footage develops the character vivian who had little relevance in the shepard version moreover in the complete version the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary where she reads and fantasizes about her ideal lover shes disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm chore boy johnny applebloom a character completely absent from the shepard version but after her affair with driscoll she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a farmers wifebr br regardless of the print a girls folly is a good little film for 1917 made by one of the top directors of the 1910s maurice tourneur in it tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business including by playing a caricature of himselfthe director of the filmwithinthefilm the two leads also give quality performances by early screenacting standards robert warwick an actor playing a skirtchasing star and doris kenyon as an ingénue aspiring to play an ingénue on the screenbr br selfreferential films which made filmmaking the focus of the films were nothing new by now mack sennett had already parodied this type of film three years prior with mabels dramatic career several aspects of this one stand out though frances marions intertitles are humorous including illustrations of the actors on a chessboard with a hand directing themremarkable for 1917 i especially liked the films final title cards where two observers remark on the films happy ending gee but aint that romantick and the other replies romance nuthin  thats movin pictures fellow female screenwriter anita loos made a similar selfreferential conclusion to another film from 1917 wild and woolly both writers helped change the role of their professions in the business and artbr br some of the photography by tourneur and john van den broek is good especially concerning the filmmaking business the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice reinforcement of the films selfreflexivity furthermore the editing is exceptional the quick crosscutting during the studio scenes is especially salient it serves to punctuate the hectic pace filmmakers work at especially back then
