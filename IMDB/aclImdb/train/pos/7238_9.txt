small spoilers alert br br good movievery good movie and im surprised to say that myself because im not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the directors name deran serafian usually means bad news most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action this movie really fascinated me good accomplishment seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved it really is the story that keeps you focused especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle of course thats where the reality and the based on a true story stops the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stokerbr br in this movie the count  vlad teppish emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman and theyre all pretty girls ill give him that overall good acting by unknown faces enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr heck its a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title these two films have nothing else in common but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture check it outmy humble opinion on to die for  8510
