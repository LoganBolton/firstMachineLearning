riff randell is a wildly obsessed fan of the rock group the ramones and so are most of the students in the school but a new tyrant of a principal ms togar thinks rock n roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones so when riff finds out theyre performing in town she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends but when ms togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but riffs friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her songbr br fun fun fun yep thats right rock n roll high school doesnt drift away from it main focus a boisterously daggy romp it wasnt what i was expecting thats for sure everyone participating in this dandy project looks like theyre having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit which makes it a priceless experience thats not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be but watching this passionately crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks i just couldnt wipe the grin off my face its tacky very cheesy densely chaotic but damn its funkydory br br this lowbudget bgrade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was cowriter  and plus he codirected some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichés and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults who always know best these features might not be particularly fresh but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically gusto treatment the film has just one thing on mind to go out on a bang and they manage to do that courtesy of the ramones who play themselves really you could say its one big trendy video clip since its all about the ramones well most of it anyway i see a lot flack towards the ramones acting ability these are musicians not actors which means its not about their acting here its the music were suppose to dig theyre here to perform which they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe especially their flamboyant concert performances the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo the velvet underground mc5 fleetwood mack eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well especially in the scenes involving ms togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to its sometimes clever tongueincheek dialogue thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itselfbr br what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles better known for her performance in halloween who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell other exemplary performances were dey young as the extremely cute kate rambeau vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer whos stupendously played by clint howard also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov whos excellent as the demanding ms togar whos pushing her unfair reign on the students paul bartel as mr mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy but that goes down well with the material and theres a certain likability stemming from these characters but we totally despise ms togar and her hall monitor goonsbr br theres no beating around the bush here when i say rock n roll high school is an intoxicating hoot of a rad time
