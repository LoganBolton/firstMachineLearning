when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of the lost boys1987to my surprise to die for is a really good movieits a little bit corny at timesbut still there are enough stylish setpieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiaststhis is a perfect mix of romance and horror and its surprisingly gory at timeshighly recommended
