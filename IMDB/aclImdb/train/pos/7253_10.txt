not sure one can call this an antiwar film it shows war at an elite level these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it even when they are pacifist they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes even if it does go against being a pacifist the movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies gomore so by todays standards no body parts flying off as in modern movies it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level this is more of a thinking mans movie once you start to watch you dont want to miss anything the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions is what the movie is about not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline this maybe called a war trillerbr br if you are into the skill of war if you are into reading or seeing programs about the sas and so on you want to watch this moviebr br comparable movies are the hill 1965 with sean connery 49th parallel 1941 with an all star cast the naked and the dead 1958 with cliff robertson all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level enjoy
