before i begin let me tell you how great this standup special sounds when you play sonic adventure i dx directors cut at the same time red mountain level in particular so while watching this standup special i suggest no demand you do itbr br carlos mencia takes his standup to the extreme in san francisco california there he makes fun of everybody with absolutely no apologiesbr br i am pretty much thanking god here that carlos didnt do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again he does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it i know a couple of times i said after carlos said a joke damn this guy makes a good point and then the game over screen came over my tv because i forgot i was playing sonic adventure i dx directors cut my bad  so yeah theres nothing to complain about this standup special if you have tivo or something like that please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour
