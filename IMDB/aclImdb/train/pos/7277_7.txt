this is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient hohokam indians she takes a really fake looking mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it well pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy and shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the womans family this is actually really boring overall and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it but if you keep at it you may just make it to the end br br ahah what is the secret of the mummy is the mummys spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave you may not be able to ascertain what the spirits motivation is but if you like spooky shenanigans on a lowbudget and 70s hairstyles this will have a certain comforting appealbr br the way i have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled boring way the film lays the story out can a boring movie really be fascinating wellsomehow this one achieves that maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way i dont know what i do know is that i enjoyed it quite a bit despite its dullnessbr br fans of spider baby will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one including an instrumental version of the theme songbr br featuring one frightening and fairly welldone sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky but this one scene is actually pretty scarybr br see this its weird and its worth your time you might even want one on your shelf
