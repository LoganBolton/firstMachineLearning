ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesnt let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isnt really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummybr br one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mothers secret is pretty frighteningbr br okay the acting in the film isnt all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr flocker youve done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one
