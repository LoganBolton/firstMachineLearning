one of the best if not the best rocknroll movies ever and its not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film doesnt at all take itself too seriouslywhich is whats great about itbr br i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late 1970s it made me kind of nostalgic br br like i said this film doesnt take itself that seriously and isnt pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of its not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated thats rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule
