of watching this as a child although ill probably find it godawful now it was kindof spooky stuff as i was only seven or so i also recall working on a saturdayafternoon puzzle while watching it so i wasnt really paying much attention however the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since ive asked numerous people if theyve seen this flick but to no avail 12 years ago one person mentioned that possibly he had seen it but he thought it merely a dream a fanciful piffle like wind its no dream my friend no dreaming now again i havent seen it since then but i cant wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr anything that can stay embedded in my minds eye for 23 years deserves a 10
