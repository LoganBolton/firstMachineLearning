i love buying those cheap lousy dvds from alpha video one day i happened to buy this one its the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50s all sexed up replete with unscientific everything scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama its an enjoyable film to those who appreciate this kind of stuff and if you can suspend your disbelief enough you can actually get creeped out not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet but toward the end with the character of the perfect body its so     whats another word for mindfing
