i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features first off the film is undeniably cheaplymade with its cardboard sets limited settings and creative scientific props the acting ranges from very poorthe two strippers barely professionalherb evers as the leading man gothic overstatementleslie daniels as the assistant kurtto firstrate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancees lustful passions the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be this film is a thinking film in many ways however dont be too fooled by its real intent it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriends head with the perfect body thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties
