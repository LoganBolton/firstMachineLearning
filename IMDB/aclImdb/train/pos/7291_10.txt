when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it thats not the case with this one a great story about a young girl whos had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things rightbr br eric etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrongbr br both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film but erics performance is definitely the show stealer in this storybr br i definitely recommend this film for its complexity performance and great over all story
