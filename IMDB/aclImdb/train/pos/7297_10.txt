i truly enjoyed this film the acting was terrific as was the plot jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for the only part of this flick i would change was the ending the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channelbr br there were some interesting religious messages in this film jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature or shark if you prefer represented the antichirst there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that end of the world feel i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature i know many people wont get the references to christianity but if you watch close youll get it
