like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title michael oblowitzs latest production has grace but its also slow and ponderous the producers last outing mosquitoman3d had the same problem its hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was its passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many closeups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning 3d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety closeups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps but when youve got sharkweek on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment
