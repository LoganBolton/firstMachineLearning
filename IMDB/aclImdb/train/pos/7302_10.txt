as of this writing john carpenters halloween is nearing its 30th anniversary it has since spawned 7 sequels a remake a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those top 10 scariest movies lists its always on there thats quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around 300000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent i could go on and on but the big question here is how does the film hold up today and all i can say to that is fantastically br br pros a simple but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood an unforgettable and goosebumpinducing score by directorcowriter john carpenter and alan howarth great cinematography stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high gets some great shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain good performances from the then mostly unknown cast a good sense of humor michael myers is one scary evil guy a lot of eerie moments thatll stay with you the pace is slow but steady and never drags unlike most other slasher films this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body countbr br cons probably not nearly as scary now as it was then many of the goofs really stand out br br final thoughts i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series i know thats not a popular opinion but its really how i feel despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs and just because its been remade for a new generation doesnt mean itll be forgotten no way no howbr br my rating 55
