every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening though they usually arent most modern horror movies fit into this categorybr br then there are those movies that dont simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual they actually frighten you to a level that youve never experiencedbr br halloween is such a film it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe but nearly all of them work halloween is aweinspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a wholebr br the story is simple laurie strode jamie lee curtis is babysitting some kids on halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago of course the madman later known as michael myers begins killing the local teenage population and eventually he comes after lauriebr br sounds familiar right just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore not a chancebr br i think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of halloween because of its title halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late1970s and early1980s however while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre it is not a member br br he has a point and for a number of reasons first and foremost its downright terrifying whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gorefests one could argue that many recent ones are tongueincheek but most of those fail as well second there is almost no violence very little of which is bloody john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary and he relies very little on it actually the body count is pretty low in fact one can argue that this isnt really a horror movie at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie each gorier and more sadistic than the last he relies on ideas for scares and also skill third while some of the characters may do stupid things that sometimes seal their fate they dont do them because theyre dumb the characters are real people so instead of thinking that the characters die because theyre idiots were frightened because theyre making a mistakebr br one of the main reasons why halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that its real nothing is hard to swallow in this film theres no supernatural theres no ridiculously creative plot elements or inventive murders or whatnot instead all the set pieces and camera work save the opening sequence are simple carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action what we get is the feeling that were actually seeing a murder take place right in front of usbr br horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice its a hit or miss game which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has which im not theyd seem primitive particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the yearsbr br acting here is not a plus point because it doesnt need to be this is a movie about scary ideas not a movie about dramatic conflicted characters the actors act like real people not characters from a story nothing more the exception to this is whoever plays the shape or later known as michael myers it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill but its hard to pull off and even harder to keep people from asking why but the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifyingbr br this is carpenters movie through and through he directed it cowrote it coproduced it and wrote the chilling score of it this is a man of brilliance and his later movie the thing supports this statement though the thing is not as scary as halloween unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential as good as this film is its not without flaws the famous opening scene is disturbing but not very scary and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie its not that its bad its just that theres no good reason to fear the shape luckily carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience while theres no intimacy in this relationship it fits the purpose we grow to know the characters but not so much that its disheartening when they die but once the film gets to halloween night thats when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the endbr br while halloween may be flawed it is only slightly so it is an immensely terrifying film and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies be warned though this movie will scare the living hell out of you
