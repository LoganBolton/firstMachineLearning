in 1978 a phenomenon began the release of john carpenters halloween got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers the critics loved it the world loved it it was imitated and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic historybr br plot 15 years after a murder took place four friends all females are babysittingand having it on with their boyfriends on halloween night after escaping from a hospital the night before michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people he murders 3 of them silently and subtlety he does not speak he walks slowly he hidesbr br only one of the friends escapes after being saved by doctor loomis michaels pursuer and doctor br br there is one reason why halloween works so well simplicity we dont know where michael is we dont know why he kills and he frightens us theyre the only reasons why we are afraidbr br john carpenter wrote the movie and directed he builds unbearable tension throughout the story and scares to such a degree that sometimes we cannot watch and the climax is truly startlingbr br as horror this is essential it is terrifying and well acted it is also mysterious michael is a force not a human a force that cannot be deniedbr br the sequels focused too much around michael and his history this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown perhaps thats why this thing is a masterpiece
