i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell played by pj soles is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuffbr br it was fun energetic quirky and cool yes ill admit that the ending is wayway over the top and far fetched but it doesnt matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie its sex pot and rock n rocll foreverbr br i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not
