it took me time to really appreciate john carpenters halloween as a kid i remember i really enjoyed the sequels especially the return of michael myers which i still think is the best halloween sequel but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the pointÂ­ i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong today i truly understand this film the meaning it has the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece its not about blood and gore its not about naked chicks and lame jokes its about the worst night in laurie strodes short life its about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago this movie is meant to be scary and i think it succeeds very well its also one of the first slasher movies a horror subgenre that i always loved halloween has a very dark atmosphere creepy music and talented young actors such as jamie lee curtis in her first role need i say more anyone whos never seen it horror fan or not should do his cinematic homework right now very highly recommended
