the first time i saw this movie i fell in love with it the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost i expected a gore fest but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack its actually my ringer at the moment p the fact that i couldnt predict when hed kill and when hed disappear was a major plus in my book predictable horror movies bore me now i know the storyline had some discrepancies but if youre like me you dont even notice them until long after the movies over and youre laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion finally as i mentioned the soundtrack is timeless its one of my all time favorite theatrical scores so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake speaking of the remake i read a very comprehensive article on it and now that i know that mr zombie reveres john carpenter i have high hopes for his take on this classic this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling but its the perfect addition opener finale you name it for an all hallows eve movie marathon
