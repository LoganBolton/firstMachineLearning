i liked this movie a loti rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an eveningit turned out a particularly satisfying experience some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral valuesit manages on both countsthe leads are all good but especially the guy who starsalso wrote and produced the movieive never seen any of these actors before but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lotthe script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it i think you wont be disappointed to watch this
