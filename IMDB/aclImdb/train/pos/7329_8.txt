i really enjoyed this movie the humor was a bit absent at times but i enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film this is the only the second movie where i saw verdone acting the other was un sacco bello and i can see why italians find him tiresome but he think he played his role well as the loving fatherbr br my one drawback with this movie was that i knew it took place in italy  somewhere in the center or south i presume but i felt like there was no representation of a place this movie could have taken place in new york boston melbourne new dehlii always think it is important for movies to have a place to give the viewers something to relate to maybe i missed something  if you like italian films then i think that you will enjoy this its not a fellini or a rossellini  its not realism or neorealism its a comical story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us
