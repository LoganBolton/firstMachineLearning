i had watched snippets from this as a kid but while i purchased blue undergrounds set immediately due to its being a limited edition only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule  and thats mainly because bakshis american pop 1981 just turned up on latenight italian tv see my review of that film below br br anyway i found the film to be a quite good swordandsorcery animated epic with especially impressivelooking backdrops the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score the plot again wasnt exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed  especially interesting is the villainous icelord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes  but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as wellendowed her bra could be torn off any second and halfnaked to boot her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass still its clearly an actionoriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving darkwolf being particularly savage the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains lair inside a cave br br in the long run apart from the aforementioned frazetta backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian 1982 and the beastmaster 1982 but also animated tv series such as blackstar 198182 and heman and the masters of the universe 198385br br as for the accompanying the making of fire and ice tv mark bakshi 1982 12br br vintage featurette on the swordandsorcery animated film which is only available via the washedout vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of liveaction performances in a studio of segments from the script  which would then be traced blended in with the backgrounds and filmed still having watched several such behindthescenes featurettes on the art of animation on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets for instance its doesnt make for a very compelling piece
