watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year it wasnt at all a bad movie certainly not average but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and onedimensional which perhaps as based on frank millers comic book was the right decision to go with but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody swordled combat with the occasional freaky creature or superhot female to go with the painterly surroundings while i would probably rewatch fire and ice before 300 again they both aroused that similar feeling  the exception this time being naturally that its frank frazetta the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics collaborating with director ralph bakshi in what isnt typical hollywood fare but something for the diehard fansbr br what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day is the possible cons mentioned before and maybe that you will see something somewhat unique fire and ice isnt even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature but its possibly the most fluid if not quite my personal favorite of the few he made and he and his team create a whole striking world thats part prehistoric part outofthisworld fantastic and part medieval and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds the skies and grounds theres a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design bakshi went as far as to say its more frazetta than him this may be true but it doesnt make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we dont see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion my favorite was the momentary skeletonguide how they rotoscoped that amazes mebr br i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it if youre already a diehard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a damsel or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada so suffice to say its about well fire against ice with characters named nekron and darkwolf the coolest male of the lot and most comicbook in appearance and teegra the typical hottie whos almost too perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure what the plot does do as an asset is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes and per usual for bakshi he conjures up some craziness if not quite his usual inspired lunacy in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material if youve seen wizards youll understand what i mean to a lesser extentbr br so if youre an animation buff seek this out right away for some oldschool ie 1980s action and incredible design for everyone else its good not great as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension with some alterations 300
