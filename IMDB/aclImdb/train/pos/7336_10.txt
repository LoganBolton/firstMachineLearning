this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi after watching it on youtube that is set in the distant past after the ice age it is a prehistoric swordandsorcery quest between good and evil nekron lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana has set their sights on conquest of the known world when their glaciers destroys the village of a man named larn he larn vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord meanwhile the subhuman minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeeps king jarols sultry daughter princess teegra but she manages to escape and eventually meets with larn who promises to escort her back to firekeep if the subhumans dont find them firstbr br this movie did very little box office as did most of ralph bakshis films but has become a cult classic partly for the quality of the art a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta also i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas the two men who had done conan comic book stories and the background painters included james gurney the illustrator of the dinotopia novels though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia and also the painter thomas kinkade noted for his artwork for figurines musicboxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings and like bakshis films the lord of the rings and american pop this movie was rotoscoped but the process works better in this film than in the formerbr br so overall i think its one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and an awesome collaboration between two great minds  ralph bakshi and frank frazetta with plenty of fantasy sexual innuendo and thrilling adventure
