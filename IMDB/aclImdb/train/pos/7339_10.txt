ever since i heard of the ralph bakshi version of the lord of the rings i wondered what the hell is rotoscope animation well i finally found out i saw this movie about three years ago not having any idea who ralph bakshi is and i liked it a lot very good story line it even has a little character development which is great for a cartoon see it if you get bored with contemporary animation dont get me wrong im not saying its just a nice cartoon its a pretty good movie too
