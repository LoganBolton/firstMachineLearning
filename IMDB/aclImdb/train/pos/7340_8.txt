this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well why dont they use this rotoscopic technique more these days its quite effectivebr br fire and ice in its prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore its esthetic quality i for sure did not mind bakshi just loves animating lushious voluptuous babes as can also be seen in cool world and i dont think he has to apoligize since its pretty much animation for adults but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot itbr br this one was just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since its possibly bakshis finest for those who like animations with lushious women try space adventure cobra as wellbr br i give fire and ice 8 out of 10
