i enjoy ralph bakshi films wizards cool world and the underrated animated lord of the rings and am a frank frazetta collector and fan i am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of edgar rice burroughs and robert e howardbr br i missed fire and ices theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me however i bought it with some trepidation because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a collectible gathering dust until the day i died fortunately my fears were groundless and i was pleasantly impressed with this moviebr br as with frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasysword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty the art is good and you see glimpses of frazetta at his best even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again however my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess very frazettaesquire i dont mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scenebr br there is rotoscoping used but personally i enjoy rotoscoping it gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animationbr br despite some continuity problems i recommend this film to all bakshi frazetta conan and sword and sorcery fans enjoy
