i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire  ice on an old oop rental videotapebr br  well for one thing this is better than any other conanesque film youll ever see sure its cheesy but who cares it stood the test of time and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotrfotr though i love that filmbr br  the plot goes like this after a battle between fire  ice a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols ice subhuman creatures while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues herbr br  yeah it doesnt sound as a original as nurse betty but thats not the point it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies fire  ice and it succeedsbr br  as for the action scenes superb they are well handled have terrific suspence and have plenty of loud noises just check out the climatic battle now thats an endingbr br  the acting and dialogue competent really they arent gonna be nominated for an oscar but they are ok and dont get on your nervesbr br  the animation is quite good shot on 3d and rotoscoped i think it looks pretty good a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn and although the character designs feel a little 1dimentional they are okbr br  overall this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical entertainment 1010
