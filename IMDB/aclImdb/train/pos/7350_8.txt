well i was a teenager when i saw the moviethe songs were a huge hit but the elite class skipped govinda movies back then coz watching govinda and karishma aka karizma movies were not the in thing for that class but anyways a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies rocked the 90s through out and most of them were successfultoday i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered there was a long que of people and the riot they created when the a aa e uo uo o song came on screenthe dresses of govinda and karishma were complimentary to each otherthe worst dressing duo of that time well karisma in the late 90s transformed but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer as his dress sense remains the samebut back then it all blended it was all good everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it was missing and then there was no looking back for this jodi as it went on n on making those indian carry on series hated by a few but loved by the massesbr br if you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on tv i dont think you will regret itbut remember its the worst at its best br br still i watch those movies when i get time coz i cant stop laughingso i say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when its done by the kings of their times it surely is watchable i recommend it to all movie lovers
