i am currently doing film studies at as level and this is not a love song is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex backstory if you scratch the surface you will find a thrillerchase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers after committing a murdersounds quite exitingbr br however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre as it is suggested it is a love story between two homosexual lovers filled with trust deceit and betrayal we are not told about this love directly through the film but the events that happen through out for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our facesbr br overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as rubbish just because they are done on a low budgetbr br a good film with an intricate story line however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters
