i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had only Â£300000 and 7 weeks to write film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself although this film is not for the masses as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homoeroticism involved in the story i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story the more sadness you feel more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not returnedbr br this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again i think that its a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all
