personally i couldnt get into this is not a love song its a brilliant film and theres a great story line to it i just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much was left of the filmbr br i love the relationship between spike and heaton there that close they depend on each other to get along in life at the same time i wish the relationship was more than what it is heaton is in love with spike but spike ibsent in love with heaton or he doesnt know how to love him the acts of betrayal on both parts have a big effect on the two men they are both devastated by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them at a time when they truly needed each other for survival
