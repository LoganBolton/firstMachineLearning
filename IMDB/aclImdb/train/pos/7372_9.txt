this is not a love song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal i believe that heaton is in love with spike but spike is too naive to see thisbr br i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences heaton shows great intimacy towards spike with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spikes name on the top of his lettersbr br one thing ive noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they havent even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers havent recognised it when they use phrases like who is heaton whats he doing with a retard like spike this person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark spike shows noticeable signs of having add although i dont think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory termbr br i really enjoyed this film although it is not for the faint hearted the film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isnt much but dialogue between the two antiheroes unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away
