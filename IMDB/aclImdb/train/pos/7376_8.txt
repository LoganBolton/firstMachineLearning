i really enjoyed this debut by ring director hideo nakata if youve seen ring beforehand then youll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick its got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant and predictable stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre if you like films that give you the chills then you will probably like this one a good creepy debut by hideo nakata 810
