its amazing that actress pj soles didnt become a big star after playing riff randall 1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones in rock n roll high school soles is so exuberant you dont mind shes obviously too old to still be in high school that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24 the movie is a fastpaced frolic that doesnt copout everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and thats just as it should be mary woronov an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazilike principal gets a great oneofakind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head how many takes did they use on that or was it a fluke and dey young is very appealing as soles best kate rambeau the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chaingang is the ramones they cant act theyre not funny and their concert segment goes on too long one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning did we meet somewhere before great fun  from
