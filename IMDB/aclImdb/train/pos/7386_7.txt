ok so the oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year and i was rooting for gosford park to win come on robert altman had deserved an oscar for years that said i guess that it was high time for an africanamerican to win best actress contrary to the previous reviewer halle berrys role in monsters ball was far more original than nicole kidmans in moulin rouge i never would have thought to nominate the latter for anything especially in a year that saw mulholland drbr br among the things that i had predicted was the stuff about the september 11 attacks i knew that they were going to say something about freedom yeah yeah robert redford should know better but contrary again to the previous reviewer whoopi goldberg is not the worst host among the past hosts was bob hope for whom i have no respect i really liked her jab at john ashcroftbr br so although i wouldnt have given a beautiful mind best picture the 74th annual academy awards still pleased me i have to admit i enjoy the oscars more than my own birthday and the day after as my parents and i were hiking around the dwellings in bandalier new mexico  it was spring break  i was thinking to myself that when jim broadbent won his oscar that most people watching were asking jim who i wonder whether or not woody allen will ever attend the oscars again
