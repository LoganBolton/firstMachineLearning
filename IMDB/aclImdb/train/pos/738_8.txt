and this is a great rocknroll movie in itself no matter how it evolved at point being a movie about disco it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out but the principal stands in their way think back to those rocknroll movies of the 50s in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock  roll music is really cool and safe for the kids and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in da ramones whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century and then for the obligatory dj guest shot the real don steele throw in too all the elements of a roger cormanproduced comedyexploitation film except for the twoday shooting schedule some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard mary wournow and dick miller there since bucket of blood and youve got one of the great stoopid movies of the day one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner induced haze at the drivein and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage
