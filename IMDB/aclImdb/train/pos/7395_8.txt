almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china there are no fancy sets explosion or glamorous peopleonly fine writing acting and direction hollywood take notebr br an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual in fact he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesnt really see the value of the old bathhouse how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believablebr br i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger hidden dragon as i dont particularly care for these frenetic films the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people
