another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the neverending crop of crud emanating from hollywood this is a story of life and living no definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial hollywood movies but rather the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselvesbr br the dynamics of all of these lives intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse and particularly its aged owner are magnificent heart touching and highly thought provokingbr br sit back relax and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life there is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to itbr br you will not be disappointed
