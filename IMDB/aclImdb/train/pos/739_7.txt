i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoebr br foxes was such a huge departure from all of thatbr br where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy little darlings anyone jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addictionbr br this was not disney this was not porkys this was not halloweed this was a dark  powerful story of the destruction of young lives sadly its a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed with a current soundtrack and still be wholly relevantbr br its not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor a trend started when she was very young in taxi driverbr br 7 out of 10 barky
