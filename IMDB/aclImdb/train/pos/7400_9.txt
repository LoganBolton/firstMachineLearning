this is a great story of family loyalty which thankfully doesnt resort to the usual tricks or at least the ones im used to seeing in american and european films of supersentimentality or high dramatic tensionbr br its very watchable and very lovable it has some beautiful cinematography but doesnt rely on that alone to entertain
