i had the privilege to see this movie at the intenational film festival of rotterdambr br xizhao or shower is a 200000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons the father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local mostly aged men come to relax and to go bathing the father has to sons a retarded son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him to this son the traditional village the bathhouse and his retarded brother seem strange and annoying but this changes along the moviebr br though the story may sound cheesy or cliche its not with really great performances especially of the father and the retarded son sorry i dont know their names and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same timebr br if you got a chance to see this movie do it its a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinemabr br
