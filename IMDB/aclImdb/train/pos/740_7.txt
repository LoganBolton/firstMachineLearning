foxes is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it porkys fast times at ridgement high the movie holds up well against timebr br its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio remember him lead a fine young cast thats well worth watchingbr br the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy awaybr br but rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislikebr br the films opening Â– a long and loving pan  sets the tone for what follows we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola while donna summers on the radio is scored beneathbr br from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life annie runaway rocker cherie currie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill deirdre kandice stroh is the boy crazy drama queen madge marlilyn stroh is the shy girl in over her head and foster is the one with the plan its her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line sally kellermanbr br its an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails atbr br despite its age foxes remains a pleasure to watch dated hair clothes and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill havent hurt the moviebr br the cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the la basin at dawn dusk and at night giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ianbr br perhaps the movies biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st elmos fire 1985 or empire records 1995 foxes shows why they should have but perhaps like bowling for soups song 1985 they just hit a wall
