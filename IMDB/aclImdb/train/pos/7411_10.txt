the key to the joy and beauty the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we dont constantly struggle against that single compelling truth in so doing we find peace elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to graspbr br in this film the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way this is a beautiful yet simple story more of a fable which is played very well watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actorsbr br i struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it im at a loss the story is about men in a bath house sounds like a real turn off right but nothing could be farther from the truth the american title for this film is the shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film which is the bath im still at a loss talking about the story or the characters will not do them justicebr br so ill just tell you how much i enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was i was also quite entertained i cared deeply for the characters and i cared deeply about what happened to them for any story that is the highest form of praisebr br if you were moved by movies like the king of masks or not one less then make sure you see the shower netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent i watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed english subsbr br
