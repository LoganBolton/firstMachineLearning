on the basis of the preview id seen i went to shower expecting a sweet little comedy what i found was a profoundly touching drama of family life told in some of the most lush photographic images ive ever been privileged to see in addition later reflection made me appreciate the abrupt cuts to scenes from the past in the arid countryside of northern china and in the high plain of tibet isnt this how memory often works one moment im here the next im in a landscape from the past just like thatbr br i would not only strongly recommend this film i would place it among the two or three finest films ive seen in my 60 yearsbr br by the way a couple of years ago another asian comedy was released in the united states as shall we dance japanese just as with shower the preview gave not the slightest indication of the depth of that film which turned out to be a subtle psychological study albeit chock full of funny moments is there a fear on the part of distributors of making films appear too important or deep to appeal to u s viewers
