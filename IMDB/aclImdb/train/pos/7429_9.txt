she is such an extraordinary singer who cares about anything else that final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz  bar none im glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes  she deserves that iconic status  such is the power of the voice br br i first saw this film when i was five and it had a huge impact on me i see it today and yes i can see some of the flaws like esther wanting to leave the grammys right as her award is being announcedbr br but some of the other user comments are just plain false  i mean where is the gratuitous nudity  maybe we saw different films br br streisands singing ability is monumental and if she has a big ego  fine br br shes earned it
