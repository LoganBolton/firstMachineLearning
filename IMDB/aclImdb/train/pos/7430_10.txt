personnaly i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their charactersbr br the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are br br thats why i didnt feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards the most rewarded movie at the golden globes an oscar and even a grammy this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it surely as a codirector her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you
