a blockbuster at the time of its original release it was the secondhighest grossing film of 1976 the third screen version of a star is born has always divided critics and fans alike the film open to scathingly negative reviews however 56 millionbudgeted picture went on to gross over 150 million at the box office and won an academy award and five golden globes its not without some irony that streisands most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial for every ten fans who state that star is streisands best film there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography although both sides have some merit to support their claims it should still be noted that the seventies take on a star is born remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that hollywood ever produced for my money its the best version of the oftentold talebr br the film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing changing the setting from the old hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters romance and their careers this is the main area that the 1976 version of a star is born actually surpasses its classic predecessors for example the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the neverending phone calls that interrupt kristoffersons songwriting attempts this version of the story is also more believable in its portrayal of the lead characters for example the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and selfsacrificing that they came off as saints on the other hand esther the female lead in this version is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate but also flawed and conflicted this makes her feel more real than the janet gaynor or judy garland characters felt in the previous films and makes the story that much more effectivebr br the performances are all on target even if some of the supporting characters arent fleshed out enough if youre looking for an actresssinger who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance streisand is definitely the girl you want shes one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural and as usual she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer simply put her esther is a fullyrealized threedimensional human being kris kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laidback characterization however hes always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from newsweek time and even the new yorkers usually vicious pauline kael gary busey and paul mazursky also give believable performances but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen timebr br the films soundtrack recording was also a massive success hitting the 1 on billboards hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the us alone the streisandcomposed evergreen with lyrics from paul williams is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop brought to evenfurther life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from streisand the rest of the films original songs mostly composed by williams and rupert holmes are pretty good as well and streisand sounds fantastic  her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded streisands vibrant performances bring woman in the moon and with one more look at you to thrilling life and make even sillier numbers like queen bee work far better than they have the right to kristoffersons solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless however that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in declinebr br though naturally dated in some respects it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made the seventies take on a star is born still holds up remarkably well the film is wellmounted and slickly produced the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine and streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective in conclusion a star is born is not only entertaining and moving but it also transcends all criticism
