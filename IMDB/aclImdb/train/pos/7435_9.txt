i first saw this video 15 years ago i thought it was excellent then and i still do i am a former teacher of english high school and college and a lover of english romantic poetry so coleridge rates highly with me anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story wouldnt get my vote of excellence in this case everything works well to engage the viewer especially high school students the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television in addition the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it okay so there wasnt a big budget for the project so it wasnt star wars and theres no cgi in it but who can dismiss gustave dor√© illustrations as part of the presentation the comment above which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash is grossly unfair and unperceptive im a friend of the producer but that isnt my reason for this comment rather im defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels it is well suited to bring coleridges poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts
