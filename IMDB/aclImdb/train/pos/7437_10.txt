recently a friend and i were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950s versus today she mentioned samuel taylor coleridge who in 1798 wrote the rime of the ancient mariner both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in english literature courses in college my friend said its messages even might be called metaphysical within todays context br br we tried reciting it and only remembered bits and pieces i have problems remembering dr seuss i said id get two copies of the poem so each could read it that was easy enough but i was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film we looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted after all the rime of the ancient mariner isnt exactly light reading after each had read the poem we watched the film togetherbr br we considered the film a remarkable achievement especially considering it was made in the 1970s before computers before the socalled ken burns effect and before special effects too often began compensating for a lack of substance particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations culled from lesser known artists such as willy pogany the early hollywood designer br br the film is narrated by sir michael redgrave whom had taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem br br its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages conveyed without instructing or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale we found it such a refreshing change from todays in your face and clobber them over the head mentality most of todays morality messages in film are twodimensional extreme violence murder and mayhem mark the bad the bad are really really bad and good are super heroes it is as if human character lacked any nuance the rime of the ancient mariner is a celebration of the individual of character of an appreciation for celebrating all the richness life has to offer within the larger context of humanity ie mans capacity to give to others br br proud of ourselves for having found this unknown gem we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at name international film festivals another surprise was learning the films director raul dasilva is a recognized authority on early animation and authored six award winning books about film br br this films message is just as relevant today if not more so than when coleridge penned the original epic poem and when raul dasilva translated it to film if i still was teaching high school which i did for five years id grab this one and show it to all my students theres a level of richness here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face whether in 1798 1978 or todayin fact as long as humanity has a spiritual componentbr br highly recommended
