the ancient mariner is a truly classic piece of work as the original poem wasis the contextsetting with the old mariner himself is fine clear and without pretense the artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the timeperiod of the setting and of the work itself carrying the audience into the period with a still yet moving accompaniment using excellent stillmovement strategies only well conquered by the premtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through often irrelevant cuts from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline the voice intonation and vitality of redgraves reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear strife and pain in addition the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itselfof the authors rendition of the ancient mariners sad and spooky tale this is a must for any love of classic poetry the sea a tall tale that almost rings true and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture who does not understand the meaning of an albatross or the concept of water water everywhere and not a drop to drink a truly fine experience thank you mr dasilva for bringing this to life for us never to be forgotten
