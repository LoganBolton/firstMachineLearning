this work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution though this is a broad generalization parents of that time were too selfabsorbed to be real parents and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues where their children were concerned br br this film teaches us how to let go even when it is painful and does so with a sweet melancholy but informed style whereby foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life i loved that scene it was my favorite scene in the movie actuallybr br the transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on and so must we baios skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better timesbr br the whole metaphor of moving on and the procession of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the endbr br i like this movie though i do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholybr br it shouldnt be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970s80s would want tobr br it rates a 7410 frombr br the fiend
