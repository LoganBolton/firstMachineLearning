personally i disdain the jerry springer show however i found ringmaster to be the funniest movie ive seen this year the neverending satire of jerry springer guests starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value
