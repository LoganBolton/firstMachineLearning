goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modernday bond champ of its timebr br this was not a bond game based on material from another medium this was a completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay was excellent and if youre a fan of the bond games or films alike youll enjoy itbr br unlike somemost games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with a very bondable storyline you feel like youre in the game as much as you get lost in a moviebr br enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game theres still plenty more to be done with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved as well as its multiplayer missions this is a standout game despite being quite old now in video game years its still a good game that you can pick up  play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it ive got the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and wellwritten storylinebr br the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesomebr br ive gotta go throw this game on now if you havent played it yet youre missing out
