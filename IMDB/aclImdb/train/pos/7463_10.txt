it does seem like this film is polarizing us you either love it or hate it i loved itbr br i agree with the comments that said you just gotta feel this onebr br also early in the film tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monetan impressionist painter monets style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess but from a distance you can tell what the subject is cruise mentions that the painting has a vanilla sky i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer this movie is like that impressionist painting its impressionist filmmaking and its no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that paintingbr br this is not your typical linear plot it requires more thought there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no youre not always going to be sure whats going on but at the end all is explainedbr br you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it after it ends is when you should think about it if you try to figure it out as its unfolding you will overwhelm yourself just let it happengo with itkeep an open mind remember what you see and save the analysis for laterbr br i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique wildly creative and spellbindingbr br but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didnt enjoy it it appeals to a certain taste if you like existential psychedelic philosophical thoughtprovoking challenging spiritual movies then see it if you prefer something a little lighter then skip itbr br but if you do like what i described then you will surely enjoy it
