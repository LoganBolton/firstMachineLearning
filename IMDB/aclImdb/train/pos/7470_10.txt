i went to see vanilla sky with a huge huge hugetom cruise fan my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend  what can i say  i was totally blown away by the movie and especially tcs performance i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expectingbr br i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it i am so pleased that i was coerced into seeing it the strange thing is i cannot say why all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day as to what i felt about the film all i can say about is its not the storyline fantasy psychodrama whatever its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events like getting into a car can change everythingbr br as to what the critics wrote yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for alejandro amen√°bar  but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope cruzbr br i cannot even consider writing a couple of trite glib sentences to describe the film just go and see itbr br yes i know this isnt a balanced thoughtful review but so what its not that kind of film
