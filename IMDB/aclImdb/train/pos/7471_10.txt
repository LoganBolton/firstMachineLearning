despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky i was expecting to be disappointed by the film because id heard that it did not get great reviews however i left the cinema completely in awe of how good vanilla sky isbr br there was no bad acting at all in the whole film every single character is believable the romantic moments between cruises character david aames and cruzs character sophia are tearjerkingly realistic and intimate probably due to the fact that they were a soontobe reallife couplebr br the plot of vanilla sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and theres very little chance of you guessing the ending however ends are tied up towards the end leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness shock and empathy for david aamesbr br the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout this isnt that hard because chances are that youll be completely drawn in to the film and wont take your eyes off the screen for one secondbr br i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple shallow films
