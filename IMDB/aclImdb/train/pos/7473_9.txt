strangely this version of open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced aided by hindsight crowes screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than amenabars original the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first but theres no doubt that crowe has improved on it  if just slightly notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky thats what i mean by more fleshed out
