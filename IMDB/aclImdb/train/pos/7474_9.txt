this is one of those movies thats difficult to review without giving away the plot suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on beyond the initial superficial tom cruise screws around with multiple women plotbr br the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all  and then loses it all diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist the story involves elements of romance morality murdermystery suspense and scifi and is generally an entertaining tripbr br i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize whats going onbr br if you enjoy wellacted movies with twists and suspense and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution then this is a mustsee br br 910
