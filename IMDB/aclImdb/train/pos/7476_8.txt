i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise i didnt cared much about tom cruises acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movienot simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead characterthey merge and then speak and its beautiful however i must say this movie doesnt come under the average flick of weekend which you pick at random and watch gleefully it carries strong sentiments and characters so dont wash this one down with your beer and popcorns it certainly needs more than that
