i could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made if you think vanilla sky is simply a remake you could not be more wrong there is tremendous depth in this film visually musically and emotionallybr br visually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with sofia and at other times powerful and intense times square postclimactic scenesbr br the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly without the music the story is only half told nancy wilson created an emotional yet eclectic score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dreamlike theme although never released i was able to get my hands on the original score for about 60 if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself crowes other musical selections such as the beach boys josh rouse spiritualized sigur ros the monkees etcetera etcetera are also perfect fits for the film crowe has an ear for great musicbr br more importantly the emotional themes in this film ie love sadness regret are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue i admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time againbr br the best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something newso watch closely and be prepared to think sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you thinkbr br this is easily cameron crowes best work and altogether a work of brilliance much of my filmmaking and musical inspiration comes from this work alone it has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is i guess to understand true art is an art itselfbr br bottom line vanilla sky is in a league of its own
