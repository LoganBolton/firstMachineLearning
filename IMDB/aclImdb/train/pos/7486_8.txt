i for one really like this movie for some reasons ill go into late but i want to touch on why i think people dont like it first off there are people out there who just like to hate tom cruise i dont understand it really second cameron crowe i think successfully pes off two groups of moviegoers with this film the casual relaxed not looking to think too hard group of moviegoers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie and the deep philosophical mysteryfans are devastated when crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mysterybr br this is a good movie and tom cruise does a very good job in it i think its probably his best performance from what ive seen all though i havent seen all of his movies or even a majority of them probably the supporting cast is good as well penelope cruz gives a solid performance and jason lee was enjoyablebr br i like the story and i think thats what vanilla sky is more than anything its a mystery an adventure and a romantic comedy but its mostly just a good story and it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy david aames cruise is the man that had everything he wanted more or less lost it was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening chooses reality simplicity and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on happinessbr br many people were disappointed that crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end i think its necessary the audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that david is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerfulbr br and the music in the movie is great its probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is particularly njosnavelin by sigur ros which is an amazing songbr br all in all id give it 3 out 4 stars its a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through and a great story for those looking to relax that moderate approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isnt a full blown mystery or a full blown love story it mixes and matches different elements and genres
