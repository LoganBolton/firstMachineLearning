i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previouslyviewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg provides a lot of history on the precivil war brotherhood among cadets at west pointbr br maybe its the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmatesbr br actually there were two classes graduated in 1861 one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a dupont first graduate of the may class and george custer last grad of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a fouryear course of study after a few years of experimenting with a fiveyear course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other george fanny or autie custer alonzo lon cushing james beauty stuart for jeb stuart class of 1854 etcbr br i say this film is santa fe trail as it should have been because that 1940 film while enjoyable really fudges history cadets from several different classes are all graduating together jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are sidebyside in stopping john browns 1859 insurrection at harpers ferry in fact stuart and custer were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at gettysburg in 1863 stuart was at the harpers ferry raid but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took placebr br fanny custer plays a role in class of 61 though his classmate chums dev oneill and shelby peyton are fictional i believe they are respectively based on partick henry ororke and john pelham two people you can look upbr br anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid19th century america
