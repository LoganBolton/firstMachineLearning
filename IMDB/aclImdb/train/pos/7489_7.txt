this film has a lot of strong points it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosikarloffchaney circle lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye plus leading man melvyn douglas its got all the right ingredients bats a castle with lots of stone staircases a mad scientist townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires an igortype character a beautiful girl even a goofyhaired burgomeister the softfocus camera work is moody and imaginative theres even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the scriptbr br but its not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in kleinschloss little castle the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist nicely played by atwill who values his work more highly than human livesbr br its not toptier material because of a hohum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye but its worth a look if you like early bw horror pictures
