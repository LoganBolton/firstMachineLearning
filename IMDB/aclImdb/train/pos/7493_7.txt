in an attempt to cash in on the success of universals horror films majestic pictures hired several popular actors from the current genre and put them in this effort that realistically speaking is nowhere near as good with that this is still worth everyones time and its a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion its better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror story takes place in the small german town of klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks burgermister gustave schoen lionel belmore shouts its vampires but the local police chief karl brettschneider melvyn douglas thinks its a madman whos responsible and he vows to catch himbr br spoiler alert the burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook herman glieb dwight frye who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave the one who is responsible for the killings is dr otto von niemann lionel atwill who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant emil robert frazer who goes out at night to collect the blood dr otto has a pretty assistant named ruth bertin fay wray and an annoying aunt named gussie maude eburne but they have no clue what hes up to but karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after hermans deathbr br frank r strayer was never confused with being james whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the blondie films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from the old dark house which was also filmed at universal im the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but its practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including frye who is pretty much doing his renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping one thing that just doesnt make sense is the mind control that dr otto has over emil as the film never explains this and i had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to the cabinet of dr caligari but on the other hand its probably just the weakest part of the script there are a few other tidbits that i noticed including the chase of frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous bronson canyon where numerous other films have been made and also wrays brown hair which is her true color true horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but i think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this its well worth a look
