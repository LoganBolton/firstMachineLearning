br br i take issue with the other reviewers comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film not a supernatural one it is not the only film to have a seemingly supernatural explanation vampires but turns out to be a very mundance onebr br other films that come to mind are edgar wallaces before dawn and the more famous mark of the vampire br br the film does a wonderful job in creating a very spooky atmosphere similar dracula when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle or in mark of the vampire when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a corpse playing an organ while luna descends using wings very surrealbr br if one likes these often silent atmospheric touches this film is a mustbr br norm vogel
