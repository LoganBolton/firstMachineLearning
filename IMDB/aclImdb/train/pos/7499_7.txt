but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifebr br perhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
