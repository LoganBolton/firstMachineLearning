basically the exact same movie as house of wax  vincent prices first genuine horror hit released the previous year  but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period setpieces joyous 3d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down prices character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw gallicos promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallicos inventions are the rightful property of the company the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallicos once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallicos rival the great rinaldi inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victims image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50s horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque grossout moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the 3d delights near the beginning of the film like a yoyo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as timefiller and contemporary 50s hype but its still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre
