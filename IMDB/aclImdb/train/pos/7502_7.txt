though i really didnt feel anything for lances character and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development perhaps with lance i would have liked it betterbr br however i have to completely agree with doyleluver when they said and to quote glenn quinns character ben im the star here in it thats right im the talented one if you watch the movie just watch him even when hes in the background just his facial expressions all in the eyes you know for sure what motivates ben exactly how he feels about comments even if its a quick look behind a characters back great acting in a fair film
