the film was okay quite entertaining the cast was pretty good and ill second what the comment before me mentioned  glenn quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie he played the selfish evil friend and manager of the band brilliantlybr br there are a lot of songs performed by beyond gravity in this film but this doesnt really come as a surprise considering the film is a vh1 production however if the soft rock pop music isnt to someones liking one might as well flash forward those scenesbr br the plot of a band trying to make it to the top in la but having to overcome many obstacles on the way isnt too original but quite entertaining with some surprising plot turns here and there
