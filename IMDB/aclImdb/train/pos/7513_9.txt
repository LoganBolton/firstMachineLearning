the notorious bettie page 2005 br br directed by mary harron br br starring gretchen mol chris bauer lili taylor sarah paulson  david strathairn br br mpaa rating r for nudity sexual content and some language br br it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life from ray charles to johnny cash biopics are very posh right now the notorious bettie page is the latest of these to be released on dvd it features gretchen mol as the worlds most famous pinup model bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color unlike ray walk the line and finding neverland however this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie pages life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested this does not mean however that it is a bad movie in fact the notorious bettie page is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling moviea solid work of cinema this film focuses more on pages exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harrons direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream aboutbr br everyone knows bettie page played by mol whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time now most people know her as one of americas first sex symbolsa legend to many models especially those of playboy and other adultoriented magazines she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and pages bondagestyle photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar in fact the photos launched a fullfledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and pornbr br the performances in the notorious bettie page are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant i understand that when she was announced for the role many people were skeptical her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances now it will she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance david strathairn is fresh off of last years good night and good luck in which he gave one of 2005s best performances here he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused i was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in the haunting 1999 while most people ignored the movie i found it to be an enjoyable if not completely shallow horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionallydistraught nell here taylor gives yet another credible performance she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen molbr br after everything was said and done i realized that the notorious bettie page cannot be compared to other biopics such as finding neverland and walk the line it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from the beginning to the end her personal life is briefly implied but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself after all she was an adult model turned christian missionary this movie does not over dramatize anything it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not the notorious bettie page tells a simple story and that is something rare by todays standards fortunately it is quite refreshingbr br final thought the notorious bettie page is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematographybr br overall rating 910 a
