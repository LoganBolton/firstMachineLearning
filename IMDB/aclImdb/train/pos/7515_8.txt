ive known about bettie page for many a year now the softcore porn images of her from the 1950s have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today the bettie page look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then so i watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with the result did not disappointbr br among other things it was hugely entertaining to see the movies recreation of actual figures like irving klaw john willie and bunny yeager  all consider trailblazers today mary harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950s america along with a sexuality that by todays standards was innocent in the extreme i particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate bettie found herself inbr br i think that gretchen mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naiveté bettie loved to look pretty loved the attention saw nothing wrong with nudity and enjoyed dressing up in silly outfits for the camera the underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her to this day she still doesnt understand what all the fuss was about when it comes to her pictures or the sm content of thembr br this isnt to say shes uneducated or too simple to understand its just that she simply doesnt get it about fetishism and never will no harm there bettie page is simply being who she is the film captured this quite nicelybr br the social atmosphere of the 1950s depicted by ms harron and written by her along with guinevere turner makes me truly glad i live in the day and age that i do the hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world the film well captures this and brings to cheering as bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naivetébr br this film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points ms harron attempted and hit them well id recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who bettie page was and what effect she had on american culture for those with such interests then this film is a must see
