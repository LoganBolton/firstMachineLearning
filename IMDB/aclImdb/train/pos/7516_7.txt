the first twothirds of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting betty as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol comes across as a pleasant girlnextdoor type who saw nothing wrong with what she did and there certainly wasnt anything wrong with it director mary harron who also made i shot andy warhol and american psycho recreates bettys america by mixing old black and white stock footage with new degraded black and white footage once betty lands in florida and starts working with bunny yeager color is introduced bettys notoriety was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving klaw lili taylor in a great performance and chris bauer as well as john willie jared harris the scenes where harron recreates bettys bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed the early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight community betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world because the films third act is virtually nonexistent we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama flaws aside its a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer christine vachon
