i had a vague idea of who bettie page was partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of playboy apparently when she got her photo taken of her and her santa hat just that she didnt know what the mag was the movie cowritten and directed by american psychos mary harron fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough a southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in new york city where she gets into modeling and from there a lot more soon she becomes the underground pinup sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title trait attributed to her the actress gretchen moll portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film shes not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well adam and eve were naked werent they she comments a couple of times apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of pages life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period leaving behind the photo shoots for jesusbr br in all the notrious bettie page is not much more than a kind of usual biopic presented by hbo films albeit this time with the stamina for a featurefilm release the best scenes that harron captures are page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in overthetop poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms this adds a much needed comic relief to the films otherwise usual nature its not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the governments investigation into the smut that came out of such photos and underground magazines but there isnt much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties its all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along its a watchable view if youre not too knowledgeable of bette page and probably for fans too
