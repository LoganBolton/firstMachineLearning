for a film thats ostensibly about sex and leather it doesnt have any right to be as oddly sweet as it is the story of bettie page a good christian girl from the south whos momma wouldnt let her date until she married who moved to new york and ended up becoming the most successful pinup of her age is driven by an outstanding performance from gretchen moll her page cant quite reconcile the pictures that she takes nobodys allowed to touch its all fun and respectful with the pornography trials and supposed illeffects that her images have on the world around herbr br page has been an inspiration to every burlesque artist since not just because she had a figure to die for but because she invested every picture with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time rather like this film in fact filmde in both black and white and glorious technicolour its a lovely way to spend a couple of hours
