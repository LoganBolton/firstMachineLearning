bettie page was a icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous bettie who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body her acting career went nowhere but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york this madefortv hbo film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast the problem is its emotionally rather flat its difficult to form an attachment to the character since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in the selfserving government investigations are given a lot of screen time which slows down the film towards the end but its definitely worth watching for the history of the time and to see the heavyhanded government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties 710
