more a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indietype film i think the tendency would be to portray bettie page as some sort of sex vixen like a jayne mansfield but if youve truly looked carefully at betties poses she always looked happy not a you wish you could get with me haughty look nor the im just doing this because my acting career didnt work out look of a porn star and so the ladies involved with this film three female producers a female writer director female cowriter and the lovely gretchen mol who im sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence really captured the idea of a sweet somewhat naive southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol jc wouldnt be too upset with her br br gretchen mol turns out a career high performance she may just have the most perfect breasts ever which i am happy about because she did have the curse several years ago she made the cover of vanity fair when no one really knew who she was touting her as the next itgirl and lets be frank that was a bit presumptuous i mean unfortunately she has never made it to gwyneth status though not for lack of talent making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle hollywood renders you forgettable im afraid if this doesnt put her back on the alist well ill be a monkeys unclebr br intensely private bettie herself has not seen the film yet bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame jesus whatever floats your boat honey you were one helluva woman i hope youre happy wherever you arebr br congratulations mary harron youve done our cult idol justice
