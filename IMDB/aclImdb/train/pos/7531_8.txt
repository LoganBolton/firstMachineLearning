i liked it just that i liked it not like the animated series i love it the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didnt like it that much theres too much people talking about bruce being so cold but if this is around 5 years later anybody in a crimefighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isnt a flaw batgirl was awesome she really fit there as there isnt more dick grayson as a robin batman needed a good teammate not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child but heres what didnt work the new artwork it isnt horrible but to me it doesnt work in a series like batman this is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon the joker isnt a bad design but i still like the past joker but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyondreturn of the joker  so this joker isnt near as good the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice my favorite character harley quinn im in love for her they put an awesome episode for her mad love to me the best episode of this series here we finally know how she turned harley quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker but too short this is how it was to be all the series but in general i didnt like how she made harley in this series in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get punched she say nonsenses she make flaws cmon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her and here they put ridiculous like i said the only episode where i dont think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper so in general its a good series it has it upsides and downs the drawn could be better  my good kill that catwoman nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes my favorites mad love jokers millions old wounds sins of the father and cold comfort if you enjoyed batmantas you can watch this but dont spec too much in the other hand if you didnt watched tas watch this first and then watch tas in that way youre really gonna love tas d
