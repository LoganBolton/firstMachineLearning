the new batman adventures also called gotham knights takes place 5 years after the final episodes of batman the animated series btas and only aired for 24 episodes this isnt a horrible show but it just isnt as good as the original batman animated series ill start with all the things that i found not to be very goodbr br first things first the animation itself long and sweet gotham isnt dark anymore the sky is always bright red and orange btas did this also but it was drawn on a dark palate do the colour of the sky was more ominous in this show the colour of the sky is too bright it all just looks like any other kids show and doesnt seem unique like batman tas did with its dark cool art style on gotham the art style is ok but doesnt remind me of batman anymore every character is comprised of straight lines squares and triangles making characters look less humanlike in the original series btas characters look more like drawn versions of real people the animation may be more consistent here than in btas but it definitely isnt as good br br next some of the episodes seem too dumbed down and childish but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in btastwoface attempting to kill tim drakerobin 2 and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment this leads me to my next pointbr br because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the batman animated universe many villains do meet their demise or leave forever poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes twoface nearly kills penguin killer croc and himself so hes moved to arkham forever joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant though he will return later on the justice league animated series catwoman moves away to france leaving batman etc just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters the villains motives are pretty bad too there are none in btas we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined thats why they act the way they do in this show the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story its like batman just doesnt even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights he just beats them senseless this batman is a colder and meaner version of the character but since hes been doing this job for years i can see why he is so harsh br br next the redesigned character models theyre awful gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds is he sick many villains look stupid joker riddler catwoman mr freeze mad hatter and killer croc are among the worst although i do think that some characters look better bane scarecrow batgirl harley is about the same and ivy who is even hotter now has pale green skinbr br with the series having many faults some episodes are great over the edge mad love beware the creeper girls night out old wounds legends of the dark knight and never fear are my favourite ones here in my opinion all of the crossovers featuring batman in the superman animated series were great alsobr br the absolute worst part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original on the dvd features of the original batman animated series they talk about how proud they were with the art style and how difficult some characters were to animate but they did eventually succeed with the difficult animation necessary to animate clayface for example on the dvd features of the new batman adventures the creators basically say to hell with btas this is a fresh new revamp it looks better and we love how we nearly ruined the series alright that is an exaggeration when the creators cast away the amazing art style of btas that really annoyed mebr br its not a bad show but i still dont like it as much as the original animated series at least the show doesnt talk down to its audience so for that reason i still commend it though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching br br superman the animated series and justice league the animated series are great followup shows to batman the animated series and the new batman adventures so give them a watch as well
