i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasnt sure that i was getting whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies ie sister actbr br however this was not really comedy it is a drama with comedic moments so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep lookingbr br this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community i do think that it is worth a chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isnt for you
