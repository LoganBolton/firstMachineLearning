i enjoyed this movie quite a lot i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it she portrays a housewife in an africanamerican family which is moving up the social chain due to the husbands danny glover success as an attorney she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly yet a little awkward toward her the various events that arise during the course of the movie make for some laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama i give it a strong 810 i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon
