short but long enough cat soup is a very wild trip to watch one day i was just searching though my ondemand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to watch it i spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw agape the whole time i was either vacant of thought or had a fleeting one which screamed turn it off but i didnt and actually im glad i didbr br the animation is stunning very artistic odd and dark i personally loved it for the amazing animation but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myselfbr br a young boywell catgoes in search of his sisters soul in the first part shes lying sick in bed and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper her soul is split in half one is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lostbr br then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me honestly i expect they go back and their world is perhaps slowly falling apart maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the worlds in first theres a giant flood and next it dries up into a bleak desert and then everything freezes thanks to either what is god or fate as you will see then i believe they find the sisters soul in the form of an orange flower after that the whole world disappears haha totally didnt get that but it sends shivers down my spine each timebr br despite its seemingly random scenes im sure theres a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research personally i love trippy stuff like this and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it but to some people its probably not their cup of tea it comes off as highly disturbing so if you like your straight forward anime this is not a film for you if you have an open mind however i highly recommend this movie
