if you werent there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism lets face itin real life we dont say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to in this sense it works this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably jodie foster born a natural the fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the storyjodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of fatality meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you trybr br and therein is the core of the movie its not about partying its not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alonebr br if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movieit will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in we all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them we all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her we all knew the boycrazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance we all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits and we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen maybe you were one of those girls maybe like me you had been each one at one time or anotherbr br this film really captures that fragile time in life when want needs pressures womanhood childhood the world and loneliness are all embodied in each females head each factor on the precipice which aspect do you hang on to what do you toss over the edge no matter how you may want to hold on and how painful is goodbye to everything youve known thats what this movie issteps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood and how damn tough it is to keep walking if you were there you knowand love this film as i do aching and tenderly done a fine piece of captured femininity
