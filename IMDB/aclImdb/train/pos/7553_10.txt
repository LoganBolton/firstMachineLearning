when i saw this movie a few days ago my eyes were completely fixed to the screen its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime but to anyone who likes great movies period or who likes really weird stuff the style of art is beautiful the sound is perfect and the symbolism within it is breathtaking ive heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie the selfattributed description of hello kitty on acid doesnt do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions id like to find more works by whoever made this and see them
