first of all this movie is 34 minutes long which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies second of allyou need to do this this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky and pigs eating their own fried fleshthats only the beginning the scenes and images extraordinary on their own flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands rewatching furthermore the dvd includes an amazing directors commentary which given the extremely spare dialog only enhances the viewing the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup along the lines of well the artists were asking what we should do in this scene but i didnt know myself so its hard to say why it turned out as it did thats a bad paraphrase by the way also the sound throughout the film is very high quality very precise and very moody in all the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as followsbr br first viewing watch the dvd without the commentary second viewing watch the dvd with the commentary third viewing rewatch without the commentarybr br once youve watched it three times however youre not going to stop there
