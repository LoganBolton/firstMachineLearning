gender bender sexes things up a bit for the xfiles this episode has an interesting premise a good story but an ending that is wanting gender bender is also the xfiles debut for actor nicholas lea better known as alex krycek in this episode he plays michael a man attacked by one of the kindred you need to see this episode just to see nic leas less than spectacular beginning an interesting thing about the kindreds power of seduction when marty does it to his victims they become turned onto himher however when andrew seduces scully she only because disoriented and groggy and does not become attracted to andrew maybe its because marty has more experience at it than andrew this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia throughout the episode it is so wet soggy and muddy it could not have been that much fun despite the disappointing ending gender bender is still a decent episode to view
