okay that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it receivesbr br the camera work is splendid best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast minus the helpless victims is strong br br what i dont like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained why does it change sex whats the purpose and theyre aliens what kind why were they never shown again in the later mythologybr br im giving this episode a high three stars one of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me still not gonna let it ruin my entertainment
