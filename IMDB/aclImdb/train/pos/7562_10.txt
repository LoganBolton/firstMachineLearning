as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldnt expect too much from broken in disc form and yet whats most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentationbr br with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a nonanamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1851 ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferraris hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a factbr br the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd20 and dd51 mixes and whilst im uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the dd51 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score both are equally fine and free of technical flawsbr br as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and youll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the anatomy of a stunt featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of brokens preproduction production and postproduction and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall making of in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to viewbr br of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again theres also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesnt take the film too seriously ferraris pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with whats been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
