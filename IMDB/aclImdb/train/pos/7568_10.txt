saw this my last day at the festival and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days poetic moving and most surprisingly funny in its own strange way its so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyperrealistic world without seeming precious or upsetting the balance manages to seem both improvised yet completely controlled it i hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influences cassavetes malick loach altmanthe usual suspects and found their own unique style but if you like modern directors in this tradition lynne ramsay david gordon greene youre in for a real treat this is a wonderful film and i hope more people get to see it if this film plays in a festival in your city go go go
