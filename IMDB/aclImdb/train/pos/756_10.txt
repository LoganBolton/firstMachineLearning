i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror im a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldnt believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking puke isnt really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackasss league
