the third and final installment of hanzo the razor is the most concrete of them all the training even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film not for everyone this film details hanzos investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to its plot hanzo 3 whos got the gold manages to connect everything and brings it all home in the end definitely the perfect finale oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and theres a lot of needless blood and violence it is hanzo the razor after all
