as much as i have enjoyed the hanzo the razor movies three is definitely enough whos got the gold the final adventure for the japanese lawman with the impressive package is a fairly enjoyable piece of pinku cinema but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concernedbr br the film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction unfortunately after the spook turns out to be nothing but a scooby doostyle ruse cooked up by a corrupt treasury official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold director yoshio inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films the result being a rather stale affairbr br once again hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to interrogate women through the use of his mighty penis slice up his enemies and abuse his superiors on the way we get wild orgies goodnatured rape hanzo forces himself on women who wind up appreciating his willfulness and bloody swordfightsbr br if youve already seen and appreciated the first two films you might as well watch this instalment to complete the set but be warned this is probably the least satisfying one of them allbr br 65 out of 10 rounded up to 7 for imdb
