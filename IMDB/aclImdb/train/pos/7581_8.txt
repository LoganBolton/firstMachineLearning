following the brilliant goyôkiba aka hanzo the razor  sword of justice 1972 and its excellent and even sleazier sequel goyôkiba kamisori hanzô jigoku zeme aka razor 2 the snare 1973 this goyôkiba oni no hanzô yawahada koban aka razor 3 whos got the gold is the third and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible samuraiconstable hanzo the razor ittami brilliantly played by the great shintarô katsu who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers as a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in nippon sword of justice became an instant favorite of mine and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently while this third hanzo film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cultcinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss whos got the gold is a bit tamer than the two foregoing hanzo films but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous and immediately starts out fabulously odd the film begins when hanzos two assistants see a female ghost when fishing having always wanted to sleep with a ghost hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience i dont know what is shintaro katsu one of my personal favorite actors is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo a role that seems to have been written specifically for him katsu is hanzo the obstinate and fearless constable who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects the interrogated women than immediately fall for him due to his sexual powers and enormous penis which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual i will not give away more about the plot in whos got the gold but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds the supporting performances are also very good and as in the predecessors there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters this is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy hanzo series if they had made 20 sequels more i would have happily watched them all the entire hanzo series is brilliant and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors it is definitely a mustsee for all lovers of cultcinema oh how i wish they had made more sequels
