this is a strange cerebral surreal esoteric film if there is such a thing as intellectual horror cinema this film is it i started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me and it barely has a plot im going to have to see this film again multiple times before i feel i really understand it if youre the kind of person who likes my dinner with andre and films by godard or if you do a lot of mindaltering drugs you will probably enjoy this film wow
