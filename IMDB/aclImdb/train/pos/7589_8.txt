jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain he happens upon downonhisluck trickster eric tsang who immediately sees cash potential in the youngsters skills basketball is the chosen avenue for riches and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of beforebr br its all a bit shaolin soccer i guess but not so quirky or ridiculous  the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the setup youve seen it all before but its the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when its done well luckily it really is done well here some might say surprisingly with chu yenping in the directors chair i expect he had good assistants  the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect eric tsang compensates with a largerthanlife character that hes played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional momentsbr br since the film revolves around basketball its good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing the cast show some real skill including chou and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyperreal kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movies plotexistencebr br theres only one significant fight scene in the movie but its a doozy in the one against many style jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive  hes clearly pretty strong and fast for real and ching siutungs choreography makes him look like a real martial artist i wish thered been more but at least its a lengthy fightbr br very much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing
