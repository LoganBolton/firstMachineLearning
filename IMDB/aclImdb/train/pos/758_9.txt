i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme basically three welsh guys and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding and a complete disregardmasochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety they have had puking eating pubescovered pizza jumping in stinging nettles naked paint balling jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleepingsnoring stunts in a work place eg army cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises bumps blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything lee dainton also up for just about anything dan joyce the british one who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh and pancho mike locke who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
