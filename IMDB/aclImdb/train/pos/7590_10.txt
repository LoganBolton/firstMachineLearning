i dont care if youd like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isnt goodyoure so obsessed by the films of hollywood that you cant see how good is this movie im not a fan of jay chou but i like his play and not only his and may be you think that there is not a big sense in the idea and may be you think its not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than usa in the world and its good  really good and it cost a lot to do it so please dont criticize the actors the directors cause you dont know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you
