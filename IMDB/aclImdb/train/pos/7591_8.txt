a mess of genres but its mainly based on stephen chows genre mashups for its inspiration theres magic kungfu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so its easy to get past the many flaws in this filmbr br a baby is abandoned next to a basketball court a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery thats in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but cant read the old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks the new master gets mad at the now 20 year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the masters weak punches and throws him out for the night the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangsters club to play darts this leads to a big fight the boys expulsion from the monastery and the mans decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensationbr br al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie the man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film im sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end the effects photography and stunt work are all top notch and make up for the uninspired plot br br stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but thats not a good reason to ignore it its quite entertaining even with a scattershot ending recommended
