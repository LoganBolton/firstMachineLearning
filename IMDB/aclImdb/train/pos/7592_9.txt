just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinionand justice to the moviebr br first of all to get things straight this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesnt aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you discard your criticalmindedness and your longing for a good plot because you wont find any in here with that established let us further into the moviebr br i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didnt have a strong plotyes moviegoers i underrated this movie as well but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flickswhich i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and wouldve rated it a 9 as well action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right placesbr br spoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports moviesdrama that already did it well why create another spoilers endbr br im not even sure why youre reading this go ahead and watch it just remember no thinking  just watch enjoy smile laugh and br br every once in a while theythe movie industry creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump im not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have then again if were talking about stephen chowish comedy this ones a top tenbr br highly recommended if you love no brainer movies with really good action kung fu death trance kung fu and comedy what the heck watch this youll have a great timebr br 910 for you the cast of kung fu dunk
