the movie is absolutely sillybr br but were you expecting a highbrow intellectual film based on a comic called slam dunk really jay chous acting isnt exactly the most moving thing ive ever seen but i certainly enjoyed the movie was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen chow can produce no not really was it thoroughly entertaining if youre just taking it at surface value absolutely its a movie about some chinese eyecandy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise theres an evil triadstyle dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay chou involved in all of this a love interest its formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while come on its called kung fu dunk what do you really think you signed on for do yourself a favor if you watch it  i found myself a copy with some engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it they would appear to be extremely fixated on jerusalem and the numbers 1 10br br i laughed i cried i hurled id watch it againbr br especially for that fight scene in the bar well choreographed and well shot i especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table  id love to play on one of thosebr br slick enough for me but i dig on trash cinema
