i dont know the stars or modern chinese teenage music  but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see onebr br kung fu dunk is pure hollywood in its values  its played for laughs for love and is a great blend of kung fu and basketballbr br everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this  the production values are excellent  and modern china looks glossier than los angeles herebr br the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play and love and more etc is great  this is fresh fun and immensely entertainingbr br with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy  for all ages  and for our money was one of the best family movies were seen in a long timebr br please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance  we were really glad we did  a good sports comedy movie
