lost isnt the greatest tv show in history but its not far off it doesnt have the plot or characterisation of the west wing or possibly even early er however it is arguably the most continuously gripping show i have every come across i love the way i cant guess whats going to happen i love the retelling of the characters back stories which often give rise to new dimensions for us to see them in in some ways i want the show to last forever but i think they can get 67 seasons out of it before they have to end it on a glorious high the combination of the characters and their nationalities coupled with the shows fluidity for moving backwards and forwards thus extending dead characters life spans all adds to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are used to its captivating surprising and heres a little suggestion for all of you conspiracy theorists more than a little interactive keep those internet discussions going youre only adding to the plot
