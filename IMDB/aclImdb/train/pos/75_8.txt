the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films some of which range among the greatest genre gems of alltime prices greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s with films such as roger cormans brilliant poecycle still the greatest horror cycle of alltime michael reeves witchfinder general 1968 or ubaldo ragonas the last man on earth 1964 marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant mans career the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax 1953 marking his rise to stardom the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor this is not to say however that this film isnt an original delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gembr br price stars as don galico aka galico the great an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife eva gabor from him when the boss takes away one of galicos ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival the great rinaldi john emery galico snaps and a murderous spree of revenge beginsbr br dont we love vincent price when hes out for revenge some of his most famous and greatest films such as the abominable dr phibes 1971 or theater of blood 1973 were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan another mustsee for my fellow price fans
