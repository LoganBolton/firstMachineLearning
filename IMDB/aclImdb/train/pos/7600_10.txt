after becoming completely addicted to six feet under i didnt think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show well i was wrong lost is spellbinding i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off the richness of the characters the intricacies of the plot the beautiful setting are all amazing i am totally and completely hooked i dont know how the creators do it but each character touches me very deeply i feel their joy their pain everything right down to my core i dont have cable so ive been renting the series on netflix when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over i cant wait for the next disc to arrive at my house this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen
