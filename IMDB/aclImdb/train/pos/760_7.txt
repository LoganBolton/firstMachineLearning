i had not seen this movie since the late 80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it the plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick the music hip hopfreestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in breakin but i have to say that breakin 12 carry the energy  excitement to the screen a lot better its a movie i will keep in my library but its not a movie that i can watch over  over again just once in a blue moon
