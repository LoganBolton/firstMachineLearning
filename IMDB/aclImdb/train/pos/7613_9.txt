the first episode i saw of lost made me think i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster but its not like that its far more than thatbecause their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost  well its getting better every time a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed thats the real secretbr br this series rules and i cant wait to know whats really going on there i hope that they dont air the last 2 episodes in the theatersthis series deserves a 9 out of 10
