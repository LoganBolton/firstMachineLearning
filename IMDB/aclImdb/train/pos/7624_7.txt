a pretty memorable movie of the animalskillingpeople variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance ive seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldnt be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadencebr br tremaynes character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souzas music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pileup of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliffbr br all in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
