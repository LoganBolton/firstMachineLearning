i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979 im still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 12 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after elviss death that he did a fine job with this in fact i havent seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one highly recommended
