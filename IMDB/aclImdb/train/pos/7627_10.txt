i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland it all came flooding back why this hasnt had a video or dvd release yet its sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasnt been released in fact i havent seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely a role he was born to play john carpenters break from horror brought this gem that id love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes belting out most of elviss greatest hits with gusto i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from la someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesnt get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel
