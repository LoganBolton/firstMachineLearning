this movie is one of those wow movies not because its the greatest movie of all time but because it surprised me not only was it a tv movie but it was on elvis i can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one elvis but i can also safely say that kurt russel came extremely close to being the real thing it was one of the greatest impersonations that i have ever seen he had me believing that it was really him i learned a lot about elvis life from watching this movie and dont led the television part of it let you strayits actually a really fantastic film and kurt russel couldve been elvis twin
