reading the various external reviews of roger ebert and other wellknown film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie even though i only have a dubbedintojapanese video version of itbr br apparently many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before most famously in the very great its a wonderful life to me a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times its used and id be happy to see more movies using this particular premisethe discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of divine magicbr br i suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story but i dont go to movies to critique them with notebook in handi go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will br br if you are sentimental sort like myself youll be well rewarded by seeing this picture the performances are excellent throughout and the movie was very well cast wonderful choice of music too michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender jim belushi does a great job as an average joe kind of guy who wonders if his life hasnt gone as it should linda hamilton always excellent is again right on target here as the loving wife jon lovitz entertains as usual and even has some surprisingly moving moments in mr destinybr br no mr destiny is not its a wonderful life but who says it has to be taken on its own terms mr destiny is an enjoyable wellmade funny and moving film ive seen my japanesedubbed video of it numerous times and im sure ill see it several more times if that somehow makes me a lowbrow so be it im just glad that i hadnt read any reviews of mr destiny before seeing itbr br i suppose i should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars but i couldnt help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews
