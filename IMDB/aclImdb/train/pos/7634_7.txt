br br ok the film wasnt going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on its a wonderful life but its just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing 13 you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs however its an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just dont think too much in it
