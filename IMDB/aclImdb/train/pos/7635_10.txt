i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya ive enjoyed it every single time this is belushis pinnacle movie in my opinion belushi and lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you cant help but get involved once you start watching the movie has a wonderful cast of stars some already were big and others were just getting started its billed as a feel good movie and thats exactly what it is this movie teaches you that life isnt always so bad after all sometimes youve just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have when youre done watching youll appreciate the things you have a lot more and youll also be smiling you cant ask for much more from a movie in my opinion not to mention its a hilarious movie and youll never lose interest very very underrated movie here folksbr br rating from me 10 i am out
