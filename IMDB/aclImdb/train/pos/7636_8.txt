it has been some years since i saw this but remember it and would like to see it again it kind of became a therapy for me with a personal experience of my ownbr br a thirtyfive year old man laments over a highschool baseball game in which he missed the ball and his team lost he thinks about it 20 years later if only id hit that ball and how his life would be better because of it then he gets a chance to find outand gets a little more than he bargained forbr br it reminds me so much of when i was in high school i twice tried out for our drilldance team and didnt make it this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school if you were on it you were all that i didnt try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time i took it really hard id hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise and that caused me to not make it that was in 1987br br through the years even now sometimes i think if only i hadnt hit my leg i wouldve never worn those stupid tights now i dont sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past who knows it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldnt have met my sons fatherbr br i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change be careful what you wish for
