its not a big film the acting is not amazing some sub charterers are even played badly the film is not beautiful in any sense nothing really inventive or new if you like big films this one is not for you yet it has a big  really big plus on the story larrys story works because we know this story from our own lives the girl we didnt ask to a date the test weve failed the friend we let down are all in our history this movie works because it touch it its a great story because its a small one its the life we all have with regrets we all have and yet the message hits every life we could have lived would have had their downside the first time i watched it i was 15 it was shown in a party at my school 16 years later i keep reflecting on it every once in a while and every time i see it it puts a smile on my face watch it it will do you good youll be happier with what you have
