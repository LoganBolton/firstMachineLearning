this movie changed it all for mei heard of breakdancing and hiphop but had never seen it professionally done hey i was an 11year old kid from holland when i saw this movie this all changed i got actively involved in the hiphopmovement in our city started breakdancing and writing lyricsbr br to this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant but who cares if the wideshot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody its what it does to you personally that counts
