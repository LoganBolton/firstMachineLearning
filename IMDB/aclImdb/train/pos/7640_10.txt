mr destiny  355 starsbr br mr destinys theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots see scrooged to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in its a wonderful life and a century earlier in the story of scrooge as told by charles dickens in a christmas carol it involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life and witnessing how his life could have been or would have been firsthand br br in most of these types of movies the guardian angel rescues a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect or how it could have been should have been would have been in this case we are shown a businessman named larry james belushi he hates his life he lives with an unexciting wife linda hamilton and yearns for a bigger life with bigger meaning if only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago he is convinced his life would have been better i guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his subconscious side but i doubt a grown man would yearn for one single act from high school still it works in the moviebr br anyway larry is driving home from work one night where he is a penpusher along with jon lovitz when his car breaks down he wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender michael caine about the way his life is turning out this is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strikeoutbr br the bartender listens and nods apparently not worrying about any other customers this is probably due to the fact that the bar though old and tattered seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men in fact larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before this is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before larry br br so the bartender who may as well be an angel of god incarnate just like clarence fixes larry a special drink of his which ends up putting larrys life on reverse showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before but larry has no idea of any change at first just like jimmy stewart didnt realize that clarence had erased his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside and a large wrestlertype man occupying his homebr br larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run instead of marrying linda hamilton he married rene russo and moved into a large mansion with children he finds out that jon lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of his and the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life that larry has always wantedhe finds himself lusting after his old wife linda hamilton proof that sometimes money and a greatlooking yet shallow wife dont make up everything in a mans life like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness just like its a wonderful life showed the audience a mans life is what he makes it and that every person has an impact on people mr destiny shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth a lesson taught us over and over again but never quite so fluffy forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in mr destinybr br mr destiny is never exceedingly hilarious but it is a sweet goodnatured comedy that never takes itself too seriously the problem with all the its a wonderful life retreads out there like the family man is that they try to be as influential and memorable as its a wonderful life was but there are only so many times you can singlehandedly rip off a famous film and mr destiny knows this and plays right to the fact it doesnt try to be anything it isnt rather it is something it didnt try to be and this is obvious to the audience br br
