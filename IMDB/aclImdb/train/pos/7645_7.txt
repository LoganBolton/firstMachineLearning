belushi at his most ingratiating and courtney cox before friends has a small role i often think belushi is underused in hollywood and this film role is one of his best for those of you who watch his tv show this is a very different and likable character the movie itself is not earth shattering nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing the supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although lovitzs whining can get tiresome and michael caines charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not wellmeaning edge hamilton as belushis wife is unfortunately twodimensional and one wonders why he married her in addition renee russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the prom queen who got away nevertheless a nice way to spend two hours
