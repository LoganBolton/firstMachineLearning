i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories from its a wonderful life to groundhog day to 1201 among those greats is this little gem its pretty difficult to get through mr destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member from the goodhearted james belushi to the murderous courtney cox this movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film but its a fine cheerup on a rainy afternoon its also a great rental for an inexpensive date
