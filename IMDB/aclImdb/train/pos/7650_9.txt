wow i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch the tale revolves around this one family from utah and its the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch the main lead giovanni ribisi plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that hes acting all his feelings its his brother elias koteas who stole the show for me though when the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other giving fantastic performances great cast great film
