the acting fantastic the story amazing the script wonderfulbr br just a few ways to describe this movie yes its slow and it has mostly talking but the whole story of all of their lives and how its told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story i myself am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie im also to read the exectioners song which is the other half of the gilmore story this movie made me think so much about the phrase piering into the other side of the looking glass you hear a song in the movie called gary gilmores eyes which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what itd be like to have gary gilmores eyeswhich is one of the things gary gave as a transplant when he died and as you listen to it which is after the last time mikal ever sees gary you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others i recommend this movieand the book very very much
