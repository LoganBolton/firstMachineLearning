while the original 1932 version with preston foster was good theres no remake more worthy than this 1959 one or more impossible to find anywhere just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant or a script more thoughtprovoking as well as an improvement upon the original many years after the last of my several viewings of this film in 1970 i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit hed made to death row and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification hed felt with people in similar circumstances the article was about as short as the main character here and didnt cover much other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here     one of my main problems with capital punishment is that of course it is not evenly impartially applied just as many innocent people are fartoocarelessly thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough or for that matter even publicly enough the bible makes a special point in such cases about one of the more important purposes of such as a deterrent being ineffectually obscured minus not only a public viewing but also the direct participation of all as for those who claim to prove statistically that such is not an effective deterrent in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking however i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall in the apostle had been punished at all for his particular crime or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case    in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit hed recounted and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature i dont know exactly when hed become the professing christian he now makes it a special point whenever possible to emphasize that he is but as anybody should be wellaware this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye however i have no particular bone of contention concerning that per se just as theres no doubt scripturally speaking that not all and perhaps not even most shall be spared the same ultimate fate at the hands of the lord himself as a result of his sacrifice on the cross however there is a problem for me about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment for contrary to the lord himself who would love to see everybody saved ezekiel 1832 ii peter 39 they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn    what most people on either side of this superlatively everburning issue cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged at least by any strictly human reckoning yet regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is there can be no doubt that anything short of it or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth indeed ive seen the most bloodcurdling thirst for the same come out selfcontradictorily enough on fartoomany occasions whenever the categorically antideath penalty advocates are confronted even in the most rationally wellbalanced ways with the fact that although the lord died for everybody not all are thereby going to be saved afterall in order to receive absolution one must to repeat the same term reach out and receive it that is repent luke 1335 could anything make more sense    but then what about the lords command to forgive even in the case of ones enemies of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation one of the fartooprevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality as popularly misinterpreted is the way it obscuringly oversimplifies the real meaning of forgiveness the act of forgiveness does not in itself mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven when one takes a clearly sober rationally wellbalanced view here from the perspective of gods own attitude all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way seeing the light and being granted mercy this attitude is of course the very opposite of say that of jonah who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance jonah didnt want them to repent but vindictively desired that they be destroyed how selfrighteously coldbloodedly like unto most professing christians he was save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most i envy jonah almost as much as he would me however minus the repentance of the one being forgiven any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good in such a case the only one to benefit is the real christian himself
