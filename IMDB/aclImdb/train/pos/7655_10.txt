having not seen this film in about 20 years i am still impressed with it s hard hitting impact and stellar acting of course one mr mickey rooney is indeed incredible in his role as the ringleading killerin reference to another review herenone other than orson welles evoked mickey rooneys name as the greatest movie actoralso i also recall the jazzybrassy score and the bare black and white photography i love the micks last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoningi think the stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songsget a grip on yourselfthis is a great film and unjustly buried film lets get it out  side notea recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don segals babyface nelson made a couple years before last mile and also starring mickey rooney another rave of the micks intense and sympathetic performanceperhaps its the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances
