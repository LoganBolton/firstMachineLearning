have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice around the time this film is setbr br it is certainly hardhitting and the opening scenes tend to set the scene the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light momentsbr br will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again he came across as a very twisted individual and i found myself disliking him more each time he appearedbr br totally agree with stevethomps articulate and well thoughtout comments
