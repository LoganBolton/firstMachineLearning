as b movies go it was well above average i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although i am trying to minimise any such tendency as sequels usually go it was utterly fantasticdespite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original scannersbr br the movie was similar in ways to the superman series in terms of the main characters description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the superman stories and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age etc the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise nonconforming children adolescents andor adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as real genius and to a more superficial degree doctor mordrid and struck a particularly strong chordbr br the film had a positive message and was fun to watch i found some of the insights and accuracy in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences fascinating and even profoundly touching at times these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formuladriven schlock and gratuitous sexuality in this case as the sexual elements were tastefully done and violence that makes b movies or shakespearian plays for that matter so much fun to watchbr br this is a must watch for all comic book scifi remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans with the right exposure in the right circles the film could develop quite a cult following along with the original scanners
