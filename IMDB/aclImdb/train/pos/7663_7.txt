as a rule a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film but because ive enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films i gave it a shotbr br its not bad not great but thats something else the film involves a struggle with a mystic evil brother who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character dr mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world which he does successfullybr br possible spoilers followbr br dr mordrid can travel between dimensions and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress however the guard has been blinded his eyes are ruined pits so the wizard passes his hands across the others eyes and hey presto his eyes have been restored this sort of healing apparently only works with eyesbr br later mordred and his brother animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight guess which one winsbr br however side from that the picture isnt at all bad though much like a comic book dr mordreds more human adventures are okay and combs plays the role convincinglybr br ive seen lots worse
