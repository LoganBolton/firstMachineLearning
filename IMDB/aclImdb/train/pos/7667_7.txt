new york city houses one man above all others the possibly immortal dr anton mordrid mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival kabal chained up so that he may not enslave the human race well wouldnt you know it a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free and begins collecting elements including platinum and uranium for his alchemy experiments with the help of a police woman named sam can mordrid defeat his evil brother dr mordrid comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection i had not heard of it which is a bit odd given that im a big fan of jeffrey combs mordrid and the film isnt that old but now its mine and i can enjoy it again and again the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style richard band provides the music which doesnt differ much from all his other scores and brian thompson plays the evil kabal we even have animated dinosaur bones what more do you want of course the cheese factor is high i felt much of the film was a ripoff of the dr strange comics and the blue pantsuit was silly and plot holes are everywhere i could list at least five but why bother and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle combs has never been a strong actor so he fits right in with the cheese these arent complaints full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like cracklaced grape nuts im guilty i loved this filmbr br if youre not a full moon fan or a jeffrey combs fan you may want to look elsewhere but if you like the early 1990s style of moviemaking and haircuts youll eat this up stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level i did i wish there was a mordrid ii but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything is gingerdead man 3 really necessary passed on this one
