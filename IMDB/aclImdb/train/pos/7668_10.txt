i loved this movie for two reasons 1 jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt and is absolutely adorable 2 the movie helped to inspire a roleplaying game i thoroughly enjoy mage the awakening ive shown it at various larp afterparties and its always a big hitbr br dd love and jeffsqueeing aside its not exactly a masterpiece but its welldone and thoroughly enjoyable the plot is fastmoving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening
