i really enjoyed doctor mordrid this is a lowbudget film which may be offputting to some but i have no problem with it i admire it even more for that considering its way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood churns out every year too bad this didnt get a theatrical release i dont know about anyone else but i would have went to see it in theatres doctor mordrid is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy especially if theyre into scifi like i am i dont see why this is a rrated film only one fword is said and there are no gruesome death scenes nor is there any blood at all the timeless rivalry between sorcerers anton and kabal anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race while kabal wanted to enslave them gave the story a sense of enchantment while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself basically this a film thats just plain fun to watch there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie though seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit that makes me laugh every time i see it but i digress anyway the acting is great the main protagonists anton and his lady friend samantha are very likable anton is sympathetic and hospitable and samantha is friendly plus the settings were wonderful the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting were only given a glimpse of it twice though it would have been great to see more scenes take place here the main setting was also very neat antons apartment is very roomy and he has some cool devices especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the worlds occurrences he even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named edgar overall this a great film it was fun to watch and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles if you can find anywhere that rents doctor mordrid you should rent it or in my case buy it it was definitely money wellspentbr br my rating 8 stars out of tenbr br
