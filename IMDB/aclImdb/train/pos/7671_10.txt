dr mordrid what can i say jeffrey combs has done it againbr br anton mordrid has been on earth for 100 years waiting for kabal an evil sorcerer to come so he can kill him mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids so mordrid knows all kabals tricksbr br the film as a little bit confusing at begin with but soon you feel a part of the action i wont give away the ending so go and watch doctor mordridbr br i found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesnt have a lot of violence in nor sexual scenes the film focused on the plot and thats what i like i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by this is because you are so engrossed in the film doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie i give it a 20 out of 10 worth seeingbr br
