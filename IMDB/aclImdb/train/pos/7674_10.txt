i had the privilege of watching holly at the edinburgh film festival last week what a powerful and moving story holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia patrick an american comes into hollys life and decides he wants to help her when holly is sold again patrick desperately searches for her we follow theyre difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunionbr br holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore
