being that i am a true product of the hiphop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time beat street although not as authentic in some respects as wild style is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sampledjbased music and electroclub culturebr br although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you cant help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the beginnings of hiphop culture in new york city in the early eighties the bboy battle scene at the roxy nightclub a reallife realtime competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc breakers is just as essential to a hiphop fans archives as any classic album watch some of the breakers moves in slowmotion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned bboybgirl all praises due to the zulu nation
