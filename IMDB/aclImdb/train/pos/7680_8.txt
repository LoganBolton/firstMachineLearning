holly is an issuedriven film but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental at its heart is it is a characterdriven film which wouldnt be nearly so successful without the fleshedout portrayals of patrick ron livingston the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience and holly thuy nguyen the strongwilled but ultimately overmatched young vietnamese girl from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing everything is forthright and welldone the contemporary classical score may put some off at first but it is topnotch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout this film which raises many issues but provides few clearcut answers ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight kudos to those who managed to get it made
