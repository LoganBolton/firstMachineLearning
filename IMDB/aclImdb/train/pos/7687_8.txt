like the jeffersons good times was one of the those classic american sitcoms which was never aired in the uk not to mention it came out in the 1970s a decade where of which i wasnt born yetbr br but like most fans of the show i watched a few episodes on you tube and afterwards i loved itbr br the evans family are headed by james and florida two parents trying to make ends meet and who despite their lack of qualifications encourage their children who have their own aspirations in life to fulfil them and to take their chances james was the strict but loving dad who didnt dare hesitate in disciplining jj michael and thelma should they overstep the line whilst florida in contrast was a fair kind hearted and considerate mother and loving wife although she was in many ways similar to james with regards to their attitudes to parenthood and family values from an afro american perspectivebr br the kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves jj was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour who would often wear multicoloured outfits and whose dynomite catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as arnold jacksons whatchoo talking bout willis from diffrent strokes michael was the smartalec who dreams of becoming a lawyer whilst sister thelma had her own dreams and hopes her verbal taunts with jj were mostly hilarious as was the lovehate relationship between brother and sister which was played out extremely well by both mike evans and bernadette stanisbr br over the seasons there were a few cameo appearances made most notably from janet jackson debbie allen and a young gary coleman as himself i actually prefer good times over say the cosby show which was an 80s show because a i preferred the evans family over the huxtables both in terms of a characterisation and bas i felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues in a way that resonated with many viewers it was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class afro americans in 1970s america the cosby show attempted to cater to the mainstream audience in a candy coated way as the huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated themselves into an upperclass us culture we would associate whites with whereas good times in contrast was much more edgier and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way i actually found that whilst the cosby show can be fun to watch at times it lacked that bit of sassiness which good times has and of which made it trendier and coolerbr br the show did jump the shark during the latter seasons as it continued after john amoss character james died in a freak accident in reality it was known at the time that john had quit good times for good and so his characters death was written as it is on the show without john the show suffered and alas it lost a lot of its charmbr br still for a sitcom good times ticked all the right boxes if only they had shown this in the uk during the 80s as it certainly is as jj would put it dynomite br br my rating 8 and a half
