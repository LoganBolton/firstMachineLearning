good times in my opinion is a mustsee cbs hit despite the fact that ive never seen every episode i still enjoy it its hard to say which one is my favorite also i really love the theme song if you ask me even though i like everyone it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tv land now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
