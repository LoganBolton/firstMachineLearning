i would like to know why john amos left the show and how did he die off the show again i couldnt relate to everything but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing by the way did they ever make it out of the ghetto i think the episode with the black jesus was my favorite we got to see them experience a few good times something they didnt have very often i wish they would bring the show back during the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch i dont think a movie or a new show would work especially without the original cast they are really what made good times goodtimes these are my questions and comments thank you
