forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed at a midfifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what im mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
