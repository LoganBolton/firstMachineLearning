vincent prices followup to house of wax 1953 the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman though a remake the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort that said apart from some resistible comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry it was another 3d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head this offers more than enough grand guignoltype thrills and overall camp value price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating missing star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet incidentally director brahms involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles both starring laird cregar he had previously helmed ie the lodger 1944 and hangover square 1945 the young leads are played by mary murphy as prices ingénue assistant and patrick oneal as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough he would himself take the lead in a similar piece chamber of horrors 1966 which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one an interesting sideline here is the latters adoption of a novel detection technique fingerprinting which is crucial in bringing about prices downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climaxthough the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run watching the star in a madetomeasure role the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a compact 73 minutes
