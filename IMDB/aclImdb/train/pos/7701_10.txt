this has always been one of my favourite movies and will always be over the last few years i have become a 50s  60s scifi freak trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were the great colours and the sets get me going too its a pity when they remake some of these good old movies they nearly always stuff it up  just look at the recent redo of the day the earth stood still its utter garbage forbidden planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time and now theyre trying to remake it too and i shudder to think what the new one will be like to my mind some things such as fantastic classic movies should just be left alone to be what they are classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories and giving people a thrill in the process once they add all the technocrap that we have available now the film just seems to be more dogmeat from the hollywood sausage factory  nothing special at all by the way i notice that the astronauts uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for queen of outer space that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then doesnt it hey less money and better films hmmmbr br great performances in this movie from leslie nielsen in a serious role and anne francis walter pidgeon who has always been one of my favourite actors earl holiman and of course robby the robotbr br the special effects are fantastic and the storyline is not too farfetched this is a great scifi experience
