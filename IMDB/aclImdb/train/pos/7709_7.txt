i know i should like this film and i do for the most part but as others have mentioned it is a bit long in the tooth i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying its a wonder they didnt start panting and howling at the moons as well i also have to say that overall the movie leaves me cold its a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film on the plus side the effects are great besides the cartoon monster as are the effects props costumes and of course robbie if the robot was not in this film i dont think it would have been as popular as it wasis the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the krell as many times as ive seen this movie the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were based on what was being produced at that time besides this island earth forbidden planet is miles above the average scifi movies of the time being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment certainly a classic in its own right flaws and all and deservedly so
