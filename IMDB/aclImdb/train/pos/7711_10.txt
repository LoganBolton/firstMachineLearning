okay so robbies a little hokeylooking by todays standards and some of the acting is pretty stilted and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program and dont get me started about the posterbr br this is still a great movie 40 years after it was released i grew up watching science fiction on the local tv stations science fictionadventure theater on sunday afternoons so ive seen quite a few sf movies from the 50s at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plotbr br i doubt that many sf movies made in the 90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030
