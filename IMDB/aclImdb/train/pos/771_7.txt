i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate there were good romanian actors around they just didnt have complex roles i applaud puyas entering the movie business i dont know why but i think hes a good guy i just hope hell be a good actorbr br the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting plotbr br i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award baftagood luck in romanian
