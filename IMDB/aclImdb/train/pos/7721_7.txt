a flying saucer manned literally by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a forbidden planet what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself inbr br on the surface this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeares tempest but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre stripped of what makes it a scifi film sure its the tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about br br underneath this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trekbr br anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful the special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable if it were not for the goofy retroartdeconess of 1950s scifi props you might think you were watching a 1960s piecebr br this is a classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi i like to call 1950s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effects the clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek lost in space and even farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star treks original series aired about 12 years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while i do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it br br some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young goodlooking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles unfortunately nielsens performance is only average and at times downright poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other films overacts his role as well ms francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot are the standout actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job the problems with the featured performances i think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything though they certainly got most of the film quite right
