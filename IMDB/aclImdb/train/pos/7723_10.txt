a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made despite some of the acting outdated dialogue etcbr br first there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell a humanoid race native to the planet now all dead who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humansus and their technology particularly the 8000 cubic mile machinebr br second there is the music and sound effects which are inseparable from each other it creates an eerie unearthly feeling unlike 2001 which had traditional classical musicbr br third its monster is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned its also based on real science and doesnt break the laws of physics and biologybr br finally and most importantly forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and more incredibly succeeds in making an honest intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human or any other biological entitys development no matter how long we survive as a speciesbr br in other words it predicts our inevitable destiny
