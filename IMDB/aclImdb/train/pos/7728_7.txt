the jist see something elsebr br this film was highly rated by gene siskel but after watching it i cant figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has interesting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isnt entertaining it also doesnt make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i dont know anyone that behaves like these characters dobr br this is a difficult movie to take on  i suggest you dont accept the challenge
