an excellent interpretation of jim thompsons novel this neonoir thriller has all the requisite elementsderanged exboxer turned drifter alcoholic widow with sinister desires excop turned smalltime crook and a kidnap plot destined for doom yet the film never crosses into cliche country but remains fresh and intriguing the performances are all superb particularly bruce derns role as the wicked sleazeball uncle bud there is a tense uncertainty to the films movement which intentional or not adds to the grim proceedings highly recommended
