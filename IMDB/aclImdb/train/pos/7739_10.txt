ever read jim thompson hes hardboiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy ive ever encountered there are rarely private detectives in his work  just losers psychotics and smalltime con artists this film has thompson nailed  if god made any real mistakes in this world it was in giving us a will to live when weve got no excuse for it every character in the film balances on a razors edge between surreal and creepy realism theres sleazy conniving uncle bud played by bruce dern and spookily wellintentioned doc goldman played by george dickerson jason patric gives a wonderful often heartwrenching performance as kid collins a nonetoobright shy exfighter whos more scared of himself than of anyone else rachel ward is fay the sexy femme fatale who we cant quite figure outits not your standard film noir nor is it intended to be after dark my sweet along with the grifters are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers jim thompson
