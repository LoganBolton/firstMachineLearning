i expected something differentmore passiondramaagain another failed attempt of originalityim sorry to say that the film falls into the old clich√© of cheesiness15 year old teens may appreciate it thoughthe acting was not very convincing and the lines commonlacking any witstill the soundtrack was good and well adaptedi cant say that this movie is a total flopbecause people do watch it but it didnt meet the publics expectations and sunk into mediocritysoto concludethe production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a halfwhich is an appreciable thingthusi guess its worth seeing if you dont get annoyed
