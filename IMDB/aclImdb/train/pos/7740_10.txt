it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this its truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films ive ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slowburning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything thats ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if youre looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isnt it you have to commit yourself to this film you cant have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and youll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever
