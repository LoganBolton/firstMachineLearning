intense actors like bruce dern jason patrick and rachel ward combine to make this modernday film noir a winner of the three i dont know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing charactersbr br patric does the narration in this noir playing an exboxer and mental patient wow that alone makes for an interesting guy he looks dumb but he isnt ward is the slinky attractive cynical intelligent and compassionate co conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad bruce dern also is in the mix and dern never fails to fascinate in about any filmbr br the movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer but i found it fascinatingand i dont like depressing movies normally what i found was a kind of quirky crime film take a look and see if you agree this is pretty unknown film that shouldnt have that status because its simply a good story and welldone
