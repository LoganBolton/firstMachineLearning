i really liked tom barmans awtwb you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts and dont expect anything its like sitting on a caf√©terrace with a beer in the summer sun and watching the people go by it definitely wont keep you pondering afterwards thats true but thats not a prerequisite for a good film its just the experience during the movie thats greatbr br i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more but being a lynch fan i dont care that much anymore br br and i loved the style or flair of this movie its slick but fresh and the soundtrack is a beauty any musiclover will get his kicks out of awtwb i can assure youbr br ill give it 8 out 10br br musicwise 10 out of 10
