barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to just as simple as that and he succeeded not only in his goal but also in making a wonderful movie especially visually he knows how to use pans slowmotion sequences tracking shots crane shots etc in a beautiful smooth way this gives the movie a very relaxing feel to itbr br the story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing a party that they all attend to which also is the turnpoint of this movie the beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother in comparance with a similar of course better movie like magnolia i simply dont think that that was barmans idea the beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences he knows people and antwerpbr br the soundtrack of the movie is also excellent but not a surprise as we know that barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band deus the music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny smooth feel of the movie other times we hear funky poprockmelodies which give some scenes the strength that they needbr br theres only one flaw and thats the last half an hour was it the runtime which was breaking me up or werent the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then i cant figure it outbr br all in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the belgian cinema upbr br 8 out of 10br br its the breeze that flows through a girls hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful its the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door its the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago its the breezebr br
