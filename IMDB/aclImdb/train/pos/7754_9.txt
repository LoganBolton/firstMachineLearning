any way the wind blows is tom barmans who is also know as front man of the rock formation deus debut movie entirely shot in antwerp belgium the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different storylines are left wide openbr br the movie has a purely instrumental sound track that will rock your socks off in most scenes the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time the main scene in the film the party is very well shotbr br the director didnt hesitate to use video clip techniques having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks ive heard latelybr br the screenplay is great stuff camera angles and colors are very well chosen the costumes are very hot and very seventies too and i loved most of the actingbr br the thing i liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd surreal very dry or even cynical humor that interleavebr br without claiming to be a comedy this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some timesbr br this is one more directors debut that shouldnt be an ending i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time cheers
