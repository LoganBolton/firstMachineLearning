im not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals whatever the case im sure i loved it from the wonderfully twisted lurid intertwining stories to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone to the vivid gaudy colour with which its all captured this is highclass trash and its great fun not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so id be lying if i said that the films sheer entertainment value didnt contribute to my love for it but theres some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional or was it comedy and i really really dug that i could really get into this melodrama stuff
