written on the wind directed by douglas sirk and released in 1956 is like all of sirks mid 50s films pure melodrama yet it is engrossing richly developed melodrama and sirks trademark lurid colour expressionism throbbing barely repressed emotions symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to cravebr br the film opens brilliantly with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his worldbr br robert stack and dorothy malone are magnificent as the two hadley kids kyle and marylee he drinks and sleeps around with women she drinks and sleeps around with men they both are worth millions thanks to the hadley oil business hunky yet poor mitch wayne rock hudson is kyles lifelong friend and marylees dream lover enter into this sordid mess lucy moore lauren bacall a slim attractive young woman who falls under kyles charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening mitch loves her too but kyle wins her they quickly marry and kyle stops drinking but fate seems to be written on the wind and it is not long before a conniving marylee who will have mitch marriage or no marriage a secretly smitten mitch the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blowsbr br malone is just wonderful as marylee hadley thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar she steals every scene she is in stack is almost just as good amping up the melodrama while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation hudson and bacall are a lot more restrained than those two yet it is in keeping with the characters they playbr br so whats all this melodrama really about it well a lot of things stacks powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear for one thing sirk surrounds stack with phallic symbols throughout the film note his tiny little gun the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol kyles seeming inability to conceive children stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex made worse by his fathers preference for hudson his sisters desire for hudson and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with hudson with all this wealth kyle hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town buying cheap corn liquor like a bumbr br its about impossible dreams and having to let go of them the river where kyle marylee and mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film symbolising kyle and especially marylees wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth in an excellent melodramatic scene perfectly pulled off by malone marylees stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child with voiceover of mitch telling marylee that she will always be his girl this is where sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer who hasnt dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood who hasnt at some point lived on a treasured memory who hasnt wanted something they couldnt have and hudsons last line of the film yes he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes only closeups recollects on how far weve come from the river marylee amazing
