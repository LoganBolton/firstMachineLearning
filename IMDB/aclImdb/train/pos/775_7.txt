its a strange yet somehow impressive story about love personnaly i never run over such a twistoff story in real life but i can image there isbr br its a story that promises to be sick from the title but after i watch it i didnt get this feeling of sickness which i would surely have regarding society rules its something beautiful in this movie something impressivewhich i cannot contradict using any moral or society rulesbr br the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex you can see how this relation starts evolves and finally ends you feel the moment when this love blossoms the first whispers touchings you feel the connection and no moment i though this is immoral you even hope it will not break in the endit cannot breakits not right you feel the pain of being hart broken in the endbr br buti need also to add a negative spin to this commenti dont know if the story is not somehow showed to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form but not in content you dont have the total story but only fragments when movie has started the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place so no clue about the nature of the relation you feel only a tension between thema fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation i think this line of kiki to sandu says all i want to stopand if you love me you will do as i ask youbr br this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moraland wheres the limit between them i dont know if the idea of this movie is love conquers alleven social and moral standards or love is beautifulno matter how or where but in my opinion this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think
