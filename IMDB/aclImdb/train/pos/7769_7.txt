lauren bacall was living through husband humprey bogarts illness  death when she did this film rock hudson was near the top of his 1950s stardom dorothy malone is in excellent form and wins an oscar for support robert stack is nominated  falls just short for his rolebr br the story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas amazing how well drunks can drive in this film  also how quickly stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequencesbr br you can see why the cast is so good  actually production wise this film is very good you can tell bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine she looks emotionally drained in some sequencesbr br the sexual references in this film are so mild that many of todays young viewers would not realize what they are film does a good job telling a story  actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made though written beyond the wind would be a good title
