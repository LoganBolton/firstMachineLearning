i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships incest and lesbianism in the romanian societybr br so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it wasnt visible at allbr br as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension didnt get throughbr br i think the soundtrack couldve been more than those few songs on the background and the theme wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrackbr br the actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 810 not enough sensuality in the key momentsbr br a total of 710 mostly for the story
