another in the they dont make em like that category this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean sometimes overthetop fun robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings and they really took the roles and ran with them malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories both honors being eminently welldeserved they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors but theyve both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here its kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a redblooded heterosexual as he does here but thats more of a personal bias than anything else but that doesnt take away from the movies overall entertainment value which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable if youre up some night and this movie comes on id say watch it its well worth it
