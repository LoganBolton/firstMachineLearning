it is ironic that during the 50s when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal he was virtually ignored by the critics he is now seen however as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodramabr br written on the wind is about the downfall of a texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation alcoholism and nymphomania it is about the twisted fatal connections between sex power and moneybr br stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration arrogance jealousy insanity and some deep insecuritiesbr br dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetites degrading herself for hudson and to other fellows in town her best line im filthy in one frantic scene we see her shaking quivering and sweating to a provocative mambo in another weeping alone over a model oilderrick at her fathers desksymbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyrannybr br the frenetic atmosphere is both made palatable and intensified by sirks magnificent use of colors lights and careful use of mirrors
