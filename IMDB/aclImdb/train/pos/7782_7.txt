the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of symbolism the 2 goldfishes  do they mean something in thai culture theres not much plot not much happens and it just meanders along no real start no real middle and no real end rather unsatisfying reallybr br it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know themit was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real the move felt chaotic and disjointed i dont know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve maybe if i were thai it would make more sense
