ive just watch 2 films of pang brothers the eye and one take only when i watched the eye i was kind of disappointed about this two guys who i had heard good words about them before that film the eye has a really bad script especially the ending childishcliche and too coincident in my opinion  but its still good in photography and experimental images so i decided to see one take only and i didnt disappointed again still great photography stunning image mtvstyle editing cool music and this timethe story has a lot of indie spiritlogical and beautiful youll see some tiny plot holes but it doesnt cause any trouble with the storyline the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd
