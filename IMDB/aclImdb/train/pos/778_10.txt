im not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep i dont think ill ever forget it one scene especially i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking is imprinted on my brainbr br i also watched the similar movie lilja 4ever as referred to by a previous commentator it was also very moving but not quite as straight to the point and brutal if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but anjos do sol angels of the sun may stay with you foreverbr br this is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to itbr br more people need to see this film
