another one of those films you hear about from friends or read about on imdb not many false notes in this one i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a deadend home town in tennessee to florida with all her worldly possessions in an old beatenup carbr br the heroine ruby makes some false starts but learns from them i found myself wondering why why didnt she lean a bit more on mikes shoulder butshe has her reasons as it turns outbr br just a fine film the only thing i dont much like about it i think is the title
