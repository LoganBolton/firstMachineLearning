in the sea of crap that hollywood and others continue to put out this is one of those diamonds in the rough a small simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didnt just waste an hour and a half of your lifebr br ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me shes extremely talentedbr br watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so i was skeptical i would even care i thought oh boy some dumb chic flick or feminist malebashing indie crap i was pleasantly surprised without analyzing the many relevant themes ill just say if you havent seen it do yourself a favor and check it out sometimes the downtoearth sliceoflife movies are the best and this is a great one
