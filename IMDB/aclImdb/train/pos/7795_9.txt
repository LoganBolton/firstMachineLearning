this will be a different kind of review ive seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there it was the first movie id seen by ashley judd and she was great and ive enjoyed every other thing ive seen her in sundances reaction made an impression on me too as did the director victor nunez who has directed and written several movies about florida this movie speaks to me and ive seen nothing with which to compare it the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings well i told you it would be a different kind of review
