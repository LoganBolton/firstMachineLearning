very slowpaced but intricately structured and ultimately very touching a nice very truetolife look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter  ive been there and this is absolutely accuratebr br its also the debut feature of actress ashley judd and she makes a big impression here its hard to believe this film is 12 years old  i remember seeing it in theaters and i recently rented ruby again except for the 80s looking clothes it has held up very nicely ashely is so radiant and touching here that its hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise anyone seeing ashley here in ruby in paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting  instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promisebr br as some other commenters say this is not for everyone as its very slow paced this is not an action film nor is it really a romance the director victor nunez ulees gold another excellent character study treats this ordinary young womans life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail in that way i think this is one of the most moving and respectful comingofage stories about young women that i can recall  its not about rubys sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturitybr br a lovely film if you take the time to watch iti think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls or boys for that matter and give them a chance to think about and discuss itbr br particular kudos to director nunez who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a femalewritten novel or memoir but in fact its mr nunezs original work rated 8 out of 10
