the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician however midway through the very successful show the police come and shut him down it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had createdeven those he made on his own time at home as a result price justifiably kills the evil man the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just couldnt stop at one sort of like eating lays potato chipsbr br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action one thing you cant say about this film is that it is dull while its also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a lookbr br had i never seen vincent prices version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 thats because while the mad magician is a wonderful film its highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it house of wax the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was rehashed in the followup film both were made in 3d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he cant stop once hes committed the first and both are great fun to watch the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mysterybr br my advice is to see this film and house of wax the price version only they are both terrific 1950s horror films
