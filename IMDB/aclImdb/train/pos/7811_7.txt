steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empires colonialism in india richard attenboroughs film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell bikos story the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african police woods played by kevin kline must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife played by penelope wilton to pressure him into forgetting about the books in that case biko dies in vain what begins as a lifechanging friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after bikos death oscarnominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on bikos rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 12 hour film wasnt exactly conducive to big box office but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway film politics aside the film still entertains and sends a message or two albeit in pgsanitized fashion  of 4 stars
