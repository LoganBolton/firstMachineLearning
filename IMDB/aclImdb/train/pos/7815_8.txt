cry freedom is a movie about how far people will go to find the truthbr br the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on bikos deathbr br although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods i found the second half about don woods struggle to have bikos story be heard around the world much more interesting
