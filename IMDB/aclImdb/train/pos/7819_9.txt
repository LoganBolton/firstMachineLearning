what a movie i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him gandhi has always left me indifferent apart from ben kingsleys performance and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times its an exciting mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washingtonbr br kline plays donald woods a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko it starts as a difficult friendship for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites but biko with his kind words upbeat attitude and complete transparency wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing aboutbr br biko is a decent lawabiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people one night coming from an illegal meeting hes arrested and beaten to death the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret policebr br this movie has an interesting structure it has in fact two narratives first it narrates the life and death of biko its an amazing first half completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yetbr br the second half no less interesting narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko woods has become an enemy of state a banned person which means he cant meet people or leave his country plus hes constantly spied by the police kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half toobr br although the first half is quite straightforward the second does interesting things with editing by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans some may argue this is to make it more interesting but for me the second half just as captivating as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africabr br the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears george fenton and jonas gwangwas score certainly had something to do with it although ive never been much of a fan of fenton cannot stand his gandhi score i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema the movie thanks to the music married to the powerful images at times reached incredible peaks of emotionbr br cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety acting writing music editing cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption
