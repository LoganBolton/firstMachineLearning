the true story of the friendship that shook south africa and awakened the world br br richard attenborough who directed a bridge too far and gandhi wanted to bring the story of steve biko to life and the journey and trouble that journalist donald woods went through in order to get his story told the films uses woods two books for its information and basis  biko and asking for troublebr br the film takes place in the late 1970s in south africa south africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race the blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army we are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants then we are introduced to donald woods kevin kline who is the editor of a popular newspaper after publishing a negative story about black activist steve biko denzel washington woods goes to meet with him the two are wary of each other at first but they soon become good friends and biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to woods this encourages woods to speak out against whats happening around him and makes him desperate to bring steve bikos story out of the clutches of the white mans south africa and to the world soon steve biko is arrested and is killed in prison now woods and his family are daring to escape from south africa to england where woods can publish his book about steve biko and the apartheidbr br when i first heard of cry freedom i was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of steve biko i had never actually heard of steve biko before i seen this film as the events in this film were really before my time but its more about the story of donald woods and his journey across the border into lesotho as he tried to elude the south african officials woods was put on a five year type house arrest after steve biko was killed so in order to publish his manuscript on steve biko he had to escape because the manuscript would be considered treason in south africa and that could have resulted in woods meeting a fate similar to that of bikos the real donald woods and his wife acted as consultants to this filmbr br denzel washington is only in the film for the first hour and i was disappointed with that as i was expecting to see him for the entire movie but he was amazing as steve biko and captured his personality from what ive read really well and his accent sounded perfect his performance earned him an oscar nomination for best supporting actor kevin kline delivers a excellent and thoughtevoking performance as donald woods and penelope wilton is excellent as his wife wendybr br filming took place in zimbabwe as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in south africa while in south africa the south african gestapo followed the film crew everywhere so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring zimbabwe instead despite everything and the fact that the apartheid didnt end til seven years later cry freedom wasnt banned in south africa but cinemas showing the movie received bomb threatsbr br richard attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination he doesnt hold back at the end of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown turns into a massacre when police open fire on them the film ends with the names of all the antiapartheid movers who died in prison and the explanations for their deaths many had no explanation quite a few were epilepsy which is hard to believe and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were suicide from hanging no one will ever know what really happened to them but i think its fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands but at the hands of others or to be more precise at the hands of the police br br cry freedom is a mustsee movie for its portrayal and story of steve biko its also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence
