billed as the story of steve biko  played excellently by denzel washington as youd expect  this was actually more the story of donald woods played by kevin klinebr br this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the rolebr br attenborough gave this the sort of direction youd expect and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get acrossbr br the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past
