i finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema id seen fritz langs film on video some years ago id been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magicbr br conditions were ideal at cinematheque ontario pristine fulllength print intertitles in the original gothicscript german with simultaneous english translation accurate without being too literal live piano accompaniment idealbr br the films magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch at least for mebr br this film bears no real relation to wagners ring cycle as i already knew but some may not wagner had adapted the 13th c niebelungenlied to his own purposes part i of fritz langs epic  siegfried  has much that will be familiar to listeners of wagner howeverbr br kriemhilds revenge is the story of siegfrieds wife kriemhild her marriage to king etzel attila the hun and her desire for revenge against hagen and gunther the rechristened nibelungs for the murder of siegfried the spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the wagnerian mythos into his götterdämmerung his twilight of the gods and the end of valhalla this film remains earthboundbr br most of the film is spectacular the massive sets rival those of cabiria 1914 which inspired griffiths intolerance 1916 their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendour theres a huge cast of scarred mangy huns and art deco burgundians and battles battles that never seem to end in factbr br kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge she manages to destroy all around her her loyalty to her martyred siegfried seems not to stem so much from love or devotion but from something closer to psychosis lady macbeth cried out unsex me here she knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do but kriemhild displays no normal human emotions and certainly nothing one equates with the feminine principle she is already top full of direst cruelty to borrow shakespeares phrase from the outset margarethe schön and her director convey this with a glower i dont want to exaggerate but that glower is virtually the only expression ever to animate kriemhilds face its the ultimate in onenote performances its clearly intentional however not simply a case of poor actingbr br what we have then on offer is a onedimensional sketch of an avenging fury some might see kriemhild as an empowered heroine i just see the film as misogynistic
