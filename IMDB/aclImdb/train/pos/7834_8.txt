please see also my comment on die nibelungen part 1 siegfriedbr br the second part of ufa studios gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor however whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scalebr br as in part one director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands these pictures should only be watched with the noteperfect gottfried huppertz score which fortunately is on the kino dvd now with this focus on mass action lang is presented with greater challenges in staging the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestrabr br but just as part one made us witness siegfrieds adventures matteroffactly and without excitement part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy in both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters thats why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of langs work thats also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkersbr br nevertheless kriemhilds revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly humanist the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the huns the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene why then did hitler and co get so tearyeyed over it a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin for hitler their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy not a human onebr br but for us nonnazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm when you see these fullydeveloped silent pictures of langs it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood rather than saddling him with lowbudget potboilers they should have put him to work on a few of those swordandsandal epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally where its the poetic operatic tonality that sweeps us along
