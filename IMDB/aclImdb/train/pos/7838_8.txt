if youre a trexmarc bolan fan i recommend you check this out it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that arent part of the concert but fun to watch leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people and when the concert is shown a talented musician both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls watching him in concert you would never know that being a rock star is a job but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances true there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there but like any album it cant have everything i just bought this in 2006 but if i would have know it came out in 1972 i would have definitely bought it years ago sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash
