the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty beauty is all around in actors play andie is superb as always in well designed shots and in authors red line idea  the lovebr br i think the kennys character is the only white spot in these three womens otherwise boring and predictable life his interaction makes andies character living as entertaining as it could possibly be when hes gone it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desiresbr br the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad instead it shows that life prevails in any forms even in this small british village which is shown perfectlybr br another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways  all that houses and fags and accents  and andie again is doing superb job it is a shame that this movie got such low marks 10 out of ten
