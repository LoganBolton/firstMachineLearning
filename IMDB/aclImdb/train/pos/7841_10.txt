this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan some might think that its a little over the top and that it is only about ringo and marcs egos but i think its similar to any other concert video except for the fact that this is marc bolan not just any guy i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution with elton john and ringo starr this clip alone is worth all the money i cant believe they didnot release this version as the single the movie is really superb especially for us danes now i wasnt alive during the 70s but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them the media didnt play or show any of the popular music back then including marc bolan and trex they only played a little with the doors only the really popular songs though so i know from my dad that seeing this gives him back a part of his youth he never got to experiencebr br i wont make this too long so if youre the least bit fan of marc bolan you need to see this you might find it boring or as said before a little over the top but at least youve seen one of the best musicians ever in actionbr br only thing that disappoints me a little is that ride a white swan isnt on the tape but i forgive it since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played
