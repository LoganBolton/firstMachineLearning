so halfway through the season i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didnt realize that the show had been canceled halfway through which is crapbr br i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on dvd later maybe then theyll see how many people were disappointed that the show didnt survive its first seasonbr br i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the oc can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared needless to say im not very happy with fox right now even more so after discovering that no ending was filmed i mean if youre going to work on a project at least finish it to see what happens a half filmed show is like a half made car its pretty much useless fox film the damn ending and give some of the shows fans some peace
