im usually not too into a specific show save for the oc  desperate housewiveshey i am 20 but no kidding after one episode of reunion i was hookedbr br i cant even say how bummed i was that its timeslot conflicted with bushs speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode which will now air next thursday again that conflict was disadvantageous because being a new show it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentumbr br that said tv doesnt always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable i dont expect reunion to take home any prizes but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked character building takes some timebr br the one episode for each year idea is wonderful in my opinion the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 with each episode being an hourand having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful please give this show a shot relax about art formits just tv
