this is one of the best animated movies ive ever seen in my life this isnt just a fun movie or a wellmade movie this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it werent just the technical skill that went into making it would grant it a place in the history of animationbr br wladyslaw starewicz created a stopmotion movie about the secret life of beetles he imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs houses nightclubs movie houses even little props like posters and bicycles and paintingsbr br in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge mr beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly much to the chagrin of a grasshopper but hes a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair mr beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the dragonfly described thus it sounds banal but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema along with emile cohl and jiri trnka wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work for that reason he must not remain forgotten
