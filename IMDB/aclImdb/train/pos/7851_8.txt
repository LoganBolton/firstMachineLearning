the cameramans revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter adultery or because its animated winsor mccay had introduced little nemo on film by this time but because it depicts bugs to tell the story ladislaw starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldnt get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stopmotion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles painting filming kissing and dancing starewicz would also make frogland 1922 and the mascot 1933 but his first notable work would be this one if youre interested in this and the other shorts mentioned check your local library to borrow the dvd the cameramant revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment
