for animation buffs its a must but even general audiences will enjoy the cameramans revenge a very early example of pixilation by the hardworking pioneer wladyslaw starewicz starewicz and his helpers painstakingly manipulated a cast of flexible insect figures to tell this story paving the way for the likes of willis obrien george pal ray harryhausen and legions of modern digital effect creatorsbr br the cameramans revenge is only about 10 minutes long but packs in lots of amusing detail as the story follows the amorous adventures of two beetles from their home to a nightclub a hotel a cinema and eventually a prison cell there are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub performed by a frog and a dragonfly a scuffle between a beetle and a grasshopper and a largescale donnybrook at the cinema which ends with the projector bursting into flames pretty elaborate goingson for 1912 when even john bray and winsor maccay were just getting started and walt disney was still in grade schoolbr br its interesting to note too what an impact the alteration of a silent movies title cards can have on the story being told ive seen two versions of this film offered by two video companies and watched them backtoback and although the image content itself is almost identical two different sets of intertitles tell two very different stories and the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story which suggests that theres another version out there somewhere the british film institutes print which has rhyming intertitles tells the story of two sibling beetles each secretly married who hide this information from one another in order to inherit their late fathers fortune the other russian print tells a simpler story of married beetles who are each guilty of infidelity in the russian version mr beetle visits his girlfriend at the gay dragonfly nightclub while in the english version brother bill beetle visits his wife at the musichall personally i prefer the straightforward and spicier russian story the bfi version tries to cram too much plot into what should be a simple tale and some of the rhymes are a bit awkwardbr br still in any rendition the cameramans revenge is a delightful film and would make an ideal leadin to that other great animated work which features beetles yellow submarine
