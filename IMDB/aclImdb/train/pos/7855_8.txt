tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy itbr br mary gives her typical spunky innocently sexy portrayal of a wrongsideoftracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir only this time the stakes are higher a false murder charge an illegitimate child and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood and contemplated suicidebr br one can see why pickford wanted to redo this one the story is a real morality tale the kind that she loved to star in the controversial topics arent always spelled out plainly a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing Â– although everything is more or less explained in the endbr br about the only negative remark i can make would be concerning jean hersholt and the dog hersholt whose character ben letts looks to be about 62 200 pounds bigger next to mary of course is sent fleeing in panic when a 60pound chocolate lab charges toward him then to top it off or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later as a bad storm hits this is the same lovable lab that sleeps with frederick lloyd hughes and cuddles with mary yet mary later throws boiling water in bens face which barely slows him ok ive vented about ben and the chocolate lab other than that the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention pickfords supporting cast was strong and believable this is certainly among her better films
