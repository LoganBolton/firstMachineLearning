had this been the original 1914 version of tess of the storm country also starring mary pickford i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens however by 1922 this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms pickfords other films such as daddy longlegs sparrows my best girl and suds tess comes up a tad shortand not every pickford film merits a 10 even if she was americas sweetheart now this isnt to say that its a bad filmit certainly isnt but i just cant see how so many have given this film a 10br br the film has a very long and complicated plotespecially because most films of the era were shorter a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land one ends up in tragedy when his daughters fiancé is killed in a scuffle with the po folks the man accused of the murder is dear old marys father though he is innocent to make things a lot worse the only witness to the real murder wont talk and the dead man had gotten his fiancée pregnant so at this point we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is in the family way theres a ton more to the film such as the cranks son falling in love with mary but its best you just see the film for yourselfbr br the film excels in some ways the plot while very complicated is also rather interesting and the cinematography is topnotch the very final scene is also pretty cute however there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take while it worked great in 1922 making her the biggest star in the world today its very dated this is not true of all her films but this one certainly isbr br by the way the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality though a few scenes are badly degradedsomething that isnt very surprising considering the age of the film also the only extras included are a brief filmography
