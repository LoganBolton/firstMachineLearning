this is yet another tellitasitis madhur bhandarkar film i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child molesion and gy concepts to the indian filmy audience but i find some of those scenes really disgusting whats new it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film mr  mrs iyer what makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with such as her roomies her colleagues film stars models rich people and others featured in the entertainment page3 in her newspaperbr br noticeable it is another good performance from mrs iyer she is likely to be noticed for this role she does selective roles but shines in them she is noticeably deglamorized and less beautiful in this film but then entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover right verdict madhur has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely however this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to conveybr br is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and gy folk the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or costars if they wish to enter bollywoodbr br in addition he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people etc he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich familiesbr br this was all okay for me but might be too complex for an average moviegoer who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work
