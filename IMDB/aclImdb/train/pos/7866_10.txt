page 3  out of 4 starsbr br madhvi konkona sen enters her boyfriends house and its empty she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture  ah another girl  that twotiming baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but its a guy this time around and i say brilliantbr br end of spoilers the above scene is not a spoiler really  but for me it was so i didnt want to take a chancebr br when asked upon as how was this film my friend answered oh it just an exposé of the p3 people which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more when i went to the theater i thought to myself  i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film but i was proved entirely wrong and then some because i could muster only the goods this film was great great not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong handsbr br konkona sen sharma is grace she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part one of the most charming actresses ive ever seen but this is not the only performance which is good in the film theres sandhya mridul boman irani and atul kulkarni particularly sandhya mridul who just fires up the screen and guess what even the unusually accented tara sharma speaks normallybr br the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hushhush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it even boman irani agrees to that statement  it was a good story madhvi thank you the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring in the end its all a rollercoaster ride and madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people just the reason why i love watching films ecstatic filmmaking the screenplay is beautiful clever and witty
