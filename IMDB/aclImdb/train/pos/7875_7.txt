page 3 is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth the film is compelling but like most of bhandarkars films it is onesided and overly pessimistic this film is all about tabloid journalism gossip celebrities the film exposes the lives of socialites whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful peculiar and repulsive they party they care for nothing but fame they plan parties at funerals they are craving for more money and a higher reputation they will do anything to get due exposure in the media to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspapers social column known as page 3 with huge photographs which will be the center of peoples discussions they are attention seeking salacious and hypocrite the film industry is shown as sleazy with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers thats where our lovely heroine a young social column reporter madhvi sharma is thrown all these people from mumbais elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvis friends are no different from these highsociety people this was tough viewing for me although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interestingbr br the films music is average the only passable songs are kitne ajeeb and huzooreala sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle respectively otherwise the soundtrack is bad one song which was particularly horrendous is filmy very filmy the films writing is quite good the second half is far better than the first as it turns more matteroffact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse thats where the film has to be applauded it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharmas characters disappointment was very easy to relate to she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive atul kulkarnis part was very small but he did full justice to it boman irani is solid as the newspapers editor sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvis sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it the films ending is really welldone and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings page 3 is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous
