the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra featuring ziggy elman buddy rich and frank sinatra red skelton shares top billing with powell and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes although skelton is more effective when he if it can be believed performs as powells love interest with virginia obrien actually providing most of the films humor as the dancers companion the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills and which must be viewed several times in order to permit ones breathing to catch up with her precision director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal and permits powells cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair as is appropriate
