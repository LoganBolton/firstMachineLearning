i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing i mean there was nothing scary about this movie it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious i think they shoudlnt have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs jason although some parts were gross like the head blowing up and any elm street film from 1 5 sucked this was the best besides number 1 i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror but if you have nothing else to do rent this and youll laugh aloti want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary freddys dead the final nightmare overall grade b
