first of all i have to start this comment by saying im a huge nightmare on elm street fan i think its the greatest horror series ever for me freddy is the boogeyman of course freddys dead which tried to be the last chapter back then is a weird movie it doesnt have the same atmosphere than the previous films freddy has a lot of screen time some think it makes him less scary which i do agree and thats in my opinion exactly the point this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better who he is who he were how he became the man haunting our dreams for some people its a bad thing its better if we never know because its scarier not to know why evil is evil obviously those people wont like rob zombies remake of halloween to truly enjoy this one you have to see things differently its not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you this was the first one and it was awesome as the years passed by freddy killed more and more people and nobody could ever get rid of him for good now its time to learn about the nature of this evil the psychological aspects of freddys realm of terror beside the story of freddys past i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie no more kids in springwood only crazy grownups the nightmare scenes are all great the soundtrack is awesome especially the opening song called im awake now performed by goo goo dolls in my opinion the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i cant believe its so underrated maybe it is misunderstood or i have different tastes anyway all freddy fans should watch it it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too and a lot of cameos get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed
