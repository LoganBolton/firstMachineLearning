ok  i admit i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie  but beyond his good looks the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plotbr br starting out were introduced to the three lead females of the movie one a headmistress  very concerned about her image and never married a police officer  with child and a bad ex to go on about the third  a power  status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three exsbr br they are almost the first wives club and indeed there is much verbal bashing of exs involved as well as some he left the credit card behaviour characters set  the movie continuesbr br mcdowells character the headmistress arrives late at a funeral  where a young organist filling in for the regular player doughty catches her eye what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief will they live happily ever afterbr br a tissue or two recommended if youre the teary type  the end uplifting but maybe not what youd expect all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action special effects and schlock horror
