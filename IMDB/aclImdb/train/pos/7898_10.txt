this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics dont usually get offbeat films i thought id give it a try unfortunately they were largely right in this instancebr br the film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting the sort of feel that is impossible to describe but its not a good one to further confound things the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interestingbr br the immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurmanbr br one thing the esteemed film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashedahemfront bottomsbr br because of the chortles acheived throughout while i wouldnt recommend this film there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different
