this was an excellent film i dont understand why so many people dont like it there was so much in it to connect with so many beautiful images and so much compassion in the things that werent said i was thoroughly entertained and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story now i havent read this particular book of robbins so i dont now how this matched up but i cant imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation the movie left a lot for you to define yourself which is the best part of any tom robbins novel dreaming up the details br br to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts far from the worst ever this movie was glorious long live the whooping crane
