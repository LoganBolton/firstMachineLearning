i admit the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues i didnt think it was very memorable in any regard but now after viewing it the 7th time i admit that it has very much grown on me the characters of sissy ms jellybean and the countess have become very endearing and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet though the plot is very weak i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it then theres the kickass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented kd lang who reminds me a little of patsy cline at her best i cant think of any movie that has grown on me after an inauspicious first impression as much as cowgirls has
