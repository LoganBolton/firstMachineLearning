worst movie of all time wow whoa now you cannot be seriousbr br maybe its all about what you expect a movie to do to you i live in oregon so i got to enjoy the beautifullyfilmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissys cradle at the beginning of the movie those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than average scorebr br or  maybe its all about what expectations you have having read the book ages ago and thinking to myself goodness no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting quirky weird book  especially 20 years later when mores morays  cant put in the accent mark online have changed  i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it againbr br sissy was exquisitely cast and i dont care what you all say i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenixs and john hurts performances i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray  and those real folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted stilted a bit stageey  always a bit on gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book imho
