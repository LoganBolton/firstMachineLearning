gus van sant has made some excellent films i truly am a fanbr br however i cant help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent ultimately though this one just didnt work br br it wasnt that the characters werent well developed or the plot and content didnt come alive its just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this were taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst andor the best and it adds to the overall rollercoaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the authors precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion rollercoaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened herebr br i suggest reading the book
