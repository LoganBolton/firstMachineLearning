i recently found a copy for 5 at a video store and snapped it up eagerly while the music and obviously graphics arent up to the standards of my favorite of the series beyond the minds eye i am still entranced by one segmentbr br stanley and stella in breaking the ice the music is brilliant and the emotions feel real the clip on odysseys website doesnt have the story nor the music unfortunately
