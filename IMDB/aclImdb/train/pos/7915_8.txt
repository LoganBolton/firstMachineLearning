this is an odysessy through time via computer animation supposedly th work of over 300 artists made in the late 80s and released in 1990 this was cutting edge stuff for the day i thought it was good and quite interesting in spotsbr br most of the short scenes made no sense just forms evolving into other forms but that was fun to watch this is all about visuals not really about any kind of a story there were some strange sequences in which oddlooking men creatures would dance around with birds overheard all of it is computer animated which was new back then even the term computer animated was not wellknownbr br its simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoonlike happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes no words just pictures with electronic music stoners must have really loved thisbr br its a nice intriguing 40 minutes of eye candy and head candy by todays cg effects this may have lost impact but i think youd still be entertained by this
