no doubt intended as a totally campy joke full moon high portrays 1950s teenager tony walker adam arkin accompanying his father ed mcmahon on a trip to romania sure enough tony gets bitten and grows fur and fangs whenever theres a full moon a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he cant age as long as he has the werewolf curse and that he has to fulfill a destiny  even if it takes twenty yearsbr br but otherwise the movies just plain funny once it gets going ed mcmahons character is an overpatriotic rightwing yahoo he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy kenneth marss coachprincipal is a tense dweeb and then theres more one of the most eyeopening cast members is demond wilson  best remembered as lamont on sanford and son  as a bus driver who gets a big surprise but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents then gag with gerald ford really summed him up anyway its a real treat considering that alan arkin  who plays a zany psychiatrist  just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons i wonder whether or not he remembers costarring with two of them in this movie aside from adam his son anthony also has a small role quite funny also starring elizabeth hartmanbr br ps director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick its alive
