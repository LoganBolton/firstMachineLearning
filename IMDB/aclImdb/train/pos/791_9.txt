having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant poignant and enriching film br br the casting was excellent i loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places but this is a film the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does yes i thought andy macdowell was great i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities i find this quite wierd because shes always a solid actress in my opinionbr br i loved the bit at the end where andys character said sometimes i feel he was never here etc it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that which i can personally identify with then there was that gorgeous classical piece nocturne i think by chopin which was a beautiful way to end bar the light comedy at the end which was probably unnecessarybr br i say well done to the film makers  i have seen 1000s of worse films
