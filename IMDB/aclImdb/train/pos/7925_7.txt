silly movie is really really funny yes its got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but its laugh out loud funny all the way and its worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook this movie is in the same class as elvira mistress of the dark another incredibly funny underappreciated film
