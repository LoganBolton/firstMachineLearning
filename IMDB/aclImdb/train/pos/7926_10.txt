i dont know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as im a fan of urban horror theres not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf just the title alone peaked my curiosity so i decided to check it out and i was surprisedits not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story is it low budget yes can you tell that its low budget yesbut once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesnt matter i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice i dont know whats up with all these bad reviews for this film all i hear is worst movie ever have these idiots seen every movie out there theres thousands of movies out there how can you categorize one as the worst ever a video not movie like zombiez may be the worst film i ever seen but i cant say that its the worst movie ever since i havent seen every movie out there bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs listen if you dont like minority based urban films the ghetto films hip hopetc then why watch these types of movies knowing that you dont like this type of stuff sure this is a horror film but its not just a horror film but its an urban horror film with a multicultural based cast i dont like tv shows like dawsons creek or the oc they suck to me films like garden state wedding crashers and i heart huckabees suck to me im a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me why because i cant relate to them they dont peak my interest just common sense believe me i will never watch garden state 2 garden salad wedding crashers 2 heres a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring now back to this movie in regards to saint405s comment above i dont know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked stupid by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me everyone did a great job the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good job im an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and its not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off anywho i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet ill be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this bring on the sequel im out jerzee representin
