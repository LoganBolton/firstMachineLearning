welcome to oakland where the dead come out to play and even the boys in da hood cant stop them this lowbudget directtovideo production seems timed to coincide with the release of land of the dead the latest installment of george a romeros famed zombie series the ghetto setting and hiphop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner city gore hounds ricky carl washington works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother jermaine brandon daniels but the teenager bored by macaroniandcheese dinners in their tract house would rather spend his time hanging with street friends marco and kev apparently there is not a lot for africanamerican highschool dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys including rival latino gang bangers ricky plans to sell their late parents house and move inland to the castro valley a more middleclass and presumably safer environment unfortunately before this can happen a driveby shooting leaves jermaine dead on the porch griefstricken ricky tries a last desperate ploy he tells scotty his lab assistant to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats when a double dose fails to revive jermaine there is no choice except to call 911 but a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue the boy is reanimated as a sputtering growling zombie chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat the feeding frenzy infects more victims and before the night is over the east bay is a battleground between the living and the bloodspattered undead the horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers from ed wood to herschel gordon lewis to charles band but low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films consider val lewtons programmers cat people the leopard man isle of the dead roger cormans poe quickies romeros night of the living dead and john carpenters halloween the difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money hood of the living dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars worth of recent highpriced horrors cheapness has its charms in truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones lending a bleakness as oppressive as douglas sirks bourgeois melodramas of the 50s lines seem more improvised than scripted so what the hell are we gonna do now just keep your eyes open for any f n thing that looks out of the ordinary ricky and scotty call their boss who calls an exmilitary man named romero i have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast not a problem says the merc closing his phone and grabbing his guns everybody has guns and even when fighting zombies theyre on their cell phones as who isnt nowadays information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement what happened we got into it with some crazy motherfockers deja f n vu its that park zombie again  ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away saying only shes gotten out of hand unlike most zombie movies this one provides a motive for mayhem jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him who in turn continue the rumble this is urban filmmaking that implies its own social commentary a nearguerrilla production suggesting a future for lowbudget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clich√©s the brothers quiroz who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired hollywood product considering their limited resources jose and eduardo quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know photographer rocky robinson gets the job done music by eduardo quiroz is no simpler than carpenters haunting halloween theme and hiphop songs by the darkroom familia and others add atmosphere the result is promising if not exactly exhilarating they are learning their craft and unlike lewis and wood who never got any better their next may be one to watch
