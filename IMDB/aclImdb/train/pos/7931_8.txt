man if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed as for myself i was expecting a lowbudgeted cheeseball zombie flick and thats exactly what i got i wasnt disappointed at all i thought it was a cool little movie the zombies were exactly as they should be because all of the zombies had just been turned so they are freshlyundead zombies obviously they did that because it wouldve been pretty costly if they had done fullon rotted zombie fx i understood the whole thing i have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie its called hood of the living dead for the love of god would you watch redneck zombies and any uwe boll movie and actually expect it to be great of course not so why there are some morons on imdb whining like school girls about this movie ill never understand oh and yes there are worse movies out there so stop saying that this was the worst youve ever seen cause you know youre full of it you ever watch zombiez or feardotcom or house of the dead those are some of the worst ive ever seen if you cant see that its just a low budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans then somethings wrong with you i just had fun with it thumbs up from me and id also like to see a sequel
