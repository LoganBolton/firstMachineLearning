this little seen movie is a languid and laidback giallo it veers away from some of the clich√©s of the genre and adopts a looser approach its about a woman searching for her missing lover a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals in true giallo style murder is never far awaybr br the cast is really rather good we have aldofo celi thunderball alida valli suspiria horst frank cat o nine tails and a very young sybil danning 80s scream queen the lead actress is rosemary dexter and while i am not familiar with her she does a good job in leading the picturebr br one of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music atypically for a giallo it features a jazzrock fusion soundtrack this score composed by roberto nicolosi is reminiscent of miles davis especially his work on in a silent way its an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny seafront scenery that the film is mostly made up ofbr br this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder setpieces well this film falls a little short in this regard its certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between the opening dreammurder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence but this really isnt a particularly violent film still i dont think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent and moments of the bizarre to satisfy while the sleazefactor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughoutbr br eye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa all under suspicion of murder we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the highly unsympathetic murder victim while this isnt a gradea example of the genre its certainly an appealingly different one as it doesnt borrow too heavily from other films of the subgenre for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day its given a nice dvd transfer it certainly deserves the treatment
