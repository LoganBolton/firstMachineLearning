i love this tv series so much it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful i cant believe that they cut it off tv and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not apparently they survive but im not sure cybersix was by far the best tv show ever i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so im really glad i got to watch it i luved it so much 3 br br its about a women by the name of cybersix she is not human she goes by adrian sieldman a man teacher at a highschool now cybersix is actually a women she is just disguised as a man in the day by night cybersix patrols the citybr br a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture herbr br if u have never watched it before u should totally download it it was the best tv show in the world why did they cut it off some people have issues but im glad i got to watch the 13 episodes
