i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much resight all of the dialogue and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh i think its amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isnt the masterpiece i once thought it was but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow and and bearing in mind it is a childrens film that is why i would still definitely give it 1010
