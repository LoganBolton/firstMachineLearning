spoilers alertbr br homeward bound the incredible journey is an important film from my life because its the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4year old scamp the story is based on the sheila burnford novel and is a reason why its not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clonebr br the basic story two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are though the young and happygolucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical due in part to his voiceover explaining his being abandoned as a pup picked up to an animal shelter and being bought by the family though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytellingbr br the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness fantastic wilderness settings by the way driven on by shadows instincts of direction they meet several perils along the way hoping to make it home while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance there are funny moments all the way through great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines see  memorable quotes and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling punctuated by moments of sadness such as when sassys arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewersbr br somehow though i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take somehow it seems a little unnecessary as part of the storybr br the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg finds it hard to get out and gives up exhausted followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out telling him how important he is to him and how hes pushed them this far so he shouldnt throw it all away so easily br br the way that this scene brilliantly done isnt concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home but shadow is nowhere to be seen then just as all seems lost he slowly appears and is reunited with the family chances conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown but also how the other two have as well hang on a second i think im going to crybr br anyway i havent read sheila burnfords book so i dont pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie but this is a film that all the family can watch and while the tots will love the talking animals older viewers will understand the plot line better as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it this film is a masterpiece in cinema and i suggest that if you havent seen it you go out and get itbr br and please avoid the sequel see my review for homeward bound ii
