first of all i loved bruce broughtons music score very lyrical and this alone added to the films charm the best aspect of the movie were the three animals superlatively voiced by michael jfox sally field and the late don ameche whereas fox has the funniest lines ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging characterthe voice of reason and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off the humans werent as engaging and sometimes the film dragged but that is my only complaint this is one beautifullooking film with beautiful close up shots of canada i believe although the film itself is quite long there is never a seriously dull moment and this is advantaged by the voice work and a wellwritten script all in all a charming and perhaps underrated film with a 910 from me bethany cox
