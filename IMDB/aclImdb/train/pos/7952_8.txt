this is one of my favorite family movies loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that im older i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times i never have much cared for animals talking or at least unanimated ones but this one ill stand up for its a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heartbr br there arent any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i dont think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least thats the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night
