this is one of the greatest childpet movies ever created i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait wait for me peter as the family car is pulling away this is a must see if you love animals best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid like when sassy says to chance cats rule and dogs drool lines like this i could do without but when i was six i bet i loved that line the storyline may seem hooky to some but i like it shadow as the older dog whos preparing chance to take over for him when hes gone is really moving when you think about it it reminded me of my childhood dog i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in homeward bound
