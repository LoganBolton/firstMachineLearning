this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what theyre thoughts are i dont know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilitiesput humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voiceover for the first has been removed only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murderproving thatafter allanimals are more interesting than people
