very few so called remakes can be as good as the originals this one crosses that border with flying colors just a remake i dont think so i saw it theatrically at the age of nine and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film br br the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film this update is more epic and cinematic still i thoroughly recommend both filmsbr br this film is certainly a mustsee for an animal lover we have the wise old golden retriever shadow the sharp sarcastic himalayan cat sassy and the young funloving american bulldog chance the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche sally field and michael j fox respectivelybr br there is virtually nothing offensive in the film there is a bit of scatological humor but nothing extreme no hard violence save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall an angry porcupine and a dark railroad shaftbr br hilarious scary moving and above all real it surprised me to see that this film didnt win any awards not one nevertheless i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays
