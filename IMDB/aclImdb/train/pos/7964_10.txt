it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i dont really like dogs fox field and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance sassy and shadow and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazingbr br i have seen this movie 72 times already i know that sounds scary but its true and every time the ending scenes still get me i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers it is indeed my alltime favorite movie
