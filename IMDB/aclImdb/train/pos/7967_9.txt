this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made its a real pleaser to anyone itll make you laugh itll make you cry and itll put you into suspensebr br basically what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation they dont know what is going on and desperately wanting to go home they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wildernessbr br this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in he provided the voice of shadow the old wise and friendly golden retriever also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy the himalayan cat but seriously what this movie is all about is chance voiced by michael j fox my alltime favorite actor chance is basically all youd expect from a dog lovable playful energetic and goofy and every time i crack up when watching this movie its because of chance its like the comedy never ends br br this movie is also very sad at times it sometimes reminds people of the times theyve been alone or when they lose their petsbr br one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesnt make it the movie had other suspenseful moments but none to me seem more suspenseful than that onebr br overall its a wonderful family movie if you enjoyed this movie youll probably enjoy the sequel too i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10
