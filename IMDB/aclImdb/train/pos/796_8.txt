thomas capano was not anne maries boss tom carper the governor was that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann rules book and saw the city confidential segment on ae tom capano was a megalomanicsp an ubercontroller and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldnt let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think its a waste of money that he is still alive
