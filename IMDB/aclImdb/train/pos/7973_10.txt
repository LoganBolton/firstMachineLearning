maybe im a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5 and i cried my eyes out between then and now embarrassed at age 15 i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them dont worry theyre tears of happiness and its not all sap theres a lot of humor and comedy in it too usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie its not the case my only word of advice even if you love thisdont see the sequalcornyness i suggest everyone checks this outyou wont be sorry no matter how old or young you are
