basically the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two scottsridley and tony lets make it straight the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actionerthriller ever madebr br when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes denzel washington and tony scotts really make a perfect duo both this movie and deja vu are better thrillers you can expect washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie one would easily be related to his characters emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road its a success that they created a superdark mexico city with a lot of shits happening one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire i dont know what would the mexicans think when they watch thisbr br well lets face it again its among the best of the death wish genre but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence its a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the missing sheep type of tragic hero in the end they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that so thats for your consideration if you also finds the movies theme is a little bit phonybr br at the end i hope one would not take this movie for realbr br 810 for art directioneditingcinematographicdenzel washington
