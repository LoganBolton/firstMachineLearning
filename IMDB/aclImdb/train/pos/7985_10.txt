this comment does contain spoilersbr br there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma panache and swagger its the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at clooneys subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in oceans 11 when they just utter each others name disdainfully terry danny you can pick any number of jacks performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lees film of the same name you can see that there is no finer an actor working today i dont mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzels work but he is definitely the cog of the production i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw emotional and incendiary all at the same timebr br washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor played very reservedly by christopher walken is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former seals and such can do very well while providing a needed service creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita i dont know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the films entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the rolebr br it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better i am interested to see how his next film domino turns out i think scott is one of todays under rated directors and with more films like this one his name will surely be elevated to icon statusbr br the story has creasy really taking to pita and visca versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad he is not around much he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy its not just a friendship between them it is more of a kinship and a deep parental love seems to be present br br the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead he becomes a literal man on fire it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance denzels anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pitas violation this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind br br also what is paramount to this films audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful the perpetrators here feel creasys wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the filmbr br man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 now that it is out on dvd my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks 1010
