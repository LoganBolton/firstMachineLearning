i liked this film a lot its dark its not a bulletdodging carchasing numb your brain action movie a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions its nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own mindsbr br in the end motivated by love or vengeance or a desire to repent  he does what he feels is right will god ever forgive us for what weve done  its not a question mortal men can answer  so he does what he feels he has to do what hes good at what hes been trained to dobr br denzel washington is a great actor  i honestly cant think of one bad movie hes done  and hes got a great supporting cast i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone
