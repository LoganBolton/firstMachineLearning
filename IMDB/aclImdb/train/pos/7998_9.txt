i loved this movie im a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico its a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washingtons character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the ones creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you cant miss it might be hard on some of you if you arent used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzykind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear youll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but im sure youll like it anyway man on fire is one of the years best movies a must own for a dvd collection 9 out of 10
