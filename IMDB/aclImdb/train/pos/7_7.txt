although i didnt like stanley  iris tremendously as a film i did admire the acting jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie i havent always been a fan of fondas work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he cant care for him anymore that will break your heart i wouldnt really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you wont see much bette acting anywhere
