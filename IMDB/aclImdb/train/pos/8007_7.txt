this game is very addictive i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you cant save a game when you are in space contributed to this at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game databr br so yes freelancer is addictive but also quite flawed also for instance something that extremely bothered me was that you couldnt skip any of the cut scenes with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time a great opportunity for me to multitask to check my email or have a chat with my friends and more things like that while i had to wait for the cut scene to be overbr br the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets also the game also ends quite abrupt at least it did so for me it is quite obvious that they are hinting at a upcoming sequel i dont know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be releasedbr br the gameplay is very easy even for those who are not familiar with flight games to put it boldly every fool can play this game yes some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort it took me about 12 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short but thank god for the multiplayer option it allows you to keep playing short missions just like the single player game once you have completed it by the waybr br even though lots of mission are the same it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive dogfightsbr br the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anythingbr br addictive game but beware of its flawsbr br 710
