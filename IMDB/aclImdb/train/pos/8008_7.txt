as far as i know this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late 60s  early 70s and most episodes are now sadly missing presumed wipedbr br series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety and i recently got the chance to watch it all the best part of 4 decades onbr br after rushing home from school freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers slade and chicory tip and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throatbr br never mind the bad  hammy acting the unintentionally amusing fight scenes plot holes wide enough to pilot a large oceangoing yacht through and the frightfully frightfully rada accents of the lead playersbr br no  forget all that because freewheelers harks back to a bygone dare i say golden age of kids tv drama when the shows were simply about riproaring fun and didnt take themselves so seriously before they became obsessed with all the angstladen ishoos that todays screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over such as relationships pregnancy drugs stis etcbr br no doubt if it were remade for a modern audience in these days of allpervasive political correctness the boss figure would be a black female one of the young male heroes would be a muslim the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an allaction gogetter with an iq off the scale whod be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish  in other words a million miles removed from wendy padburys deferential anklespraining washerupperbr br its a show thats very much of its time but is that a bad thing i for one dont think so
