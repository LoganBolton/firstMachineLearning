this was the best muppet movie ive seen ever i happen to know that miss piggys fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of muppet babies the songs will remain in my head forever only saying so because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head sorry a little off the topic there but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye hasta luego that made me laugh so hard my absolute favorite is the play at the end i was surprised that the sesame street characters popped in at the wedding im just glad this movie was very entertaining i borrowed it from the library and now i have bought it because i cant keep the librarys copy forever in conclusion i proclaim this is the best movie ive ever seen in my case its even better than austin powers in goldmember which was my favorite movie
