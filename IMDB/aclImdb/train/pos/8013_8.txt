yes its another great magical muppets movie and i adore them all the characters the movies the tv show episodes its the best comedy or musical tv show ever and all the artists behind it but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and im surely talking about the weird ending  br br i think its very dangerous to involve that much in american drama and end a love affair by marriage  we as all the poor viewers feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance peevishness and misery  so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie superman and lois lane dick tracy and tess etc so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe serenity and peace therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done youll be as mad as me br br they made the weak miserable creature kermit marry his daily nightmare the most vexatious female ever miss piggy  this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainments industry  and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage even the pathetic frog didnt have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything  therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious grossing only 25 millions visàvis 65 millions earned by the first one the muppet movie  1979 five years earlier br br simply in this movie they took manhattan and my rest too
