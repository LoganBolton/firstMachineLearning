in this muppet movie kermit miss piggy fozzie gonzo rowlf scooter camillia dr teeth floyd animal janice and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical manhattan melodies to broadway unfortunately no producer will even meet with the muppets after being denied by too many producers scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own however kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway but after he finally does and lets everybody know that he sold the show kermit gets amnesia and the others dont know where he isbr br this features many great scenes including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies a wedding sequence filled with muppets including the sesame street cast and traveling matt from fraggle rock scooter as a movie theatre usher and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfastbr br my only complaint is that more characters werent included more sure many of them appear at the wedding but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen beaker beauregard and sweetums and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet shows last season and the great muppet caper and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well after all rizzo the rat also performed by steve whitmire had a big part in this movie and he wasnt very wellknown at the time
