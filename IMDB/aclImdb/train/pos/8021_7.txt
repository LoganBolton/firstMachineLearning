the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright yet volatile lights of broadway filled with typically naïve optimism of course their first attempt fails and kermit leader of the group and author of the show blows his top so the others all go their separate ways so that he wont have to feel responsible for them kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her fathers diner the old man then has a line in particularly tortuous nonsequiturs we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars art carney as a producer james coco as an overzealous dog owner dabney coleman as a confidence trickster elliott gould who was also in the muppet movie 1979 gregory hines liza minnelli as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by kermits sporting fake moustache as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the muppets show brooke shields and even director john landis in possibly the films funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an afro wig the other muppets more or less go through their typical paces with regrettably less space given to gonzo this time around while miss piggy is something of an acquired taste with me the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be kermits romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny what disappoints however is the climactic show itself after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue which rather than the expected splashy routines procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy
