when i first saw this film in the 1980s i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the sesame streetmuppets age i honestly dont remember if i liked it at the time or not however somewhere in college i watched this film again and it wound up going and staying into my personal best films ever collectionbr br this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets i mean obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because theres humor geared towards both generations but come onjanice is accidentally overheard telling someone i dont take my clothes off for anyone even if it is artistictheres a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesnt want to hear itgonzo saves a chicken with mouthtomouth resuscitation sp and afterwards says i think were engaged nowthese and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling add to that very smart dialogue very smart new yorkbroadway wink wink humor the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that dont border on kidlevel cheesy whatsoeverthis film is a masterpiece i dont throw 10s out on a regular basisbut this one deserves it over 20 years later this film totally holds up perhaps even more so the muppets never were and never will be again as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is q
