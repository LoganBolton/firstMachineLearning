when i saw it for the first time i was really impressedthe director made such a mysterious atmosphere especially in the end through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it firstbutthe main point was not conflict butfriendshipolder and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to lifeit is amazing every time i watch it i enjoyof course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger amazing filmi advice everyone to see iti am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time
