i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperordarth sidious he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the sith eliminates his dark master a nice sacrifice the cinematography of this film is impressive i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian landos co pilot and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film1when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded 2 when luke sees the spirits of obiwan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker sebastian shawthe greatest scene in star wars 3 when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lordbr br i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader vs luke skywalker on the death star postscript the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable 910
