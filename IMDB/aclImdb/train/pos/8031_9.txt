this is one military drama i like a lot tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett this marine is nononsense in your face and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done there you have billy zanethe phantom and others who plays richard miller a former swat form dc works for the government and takes orders only from them who needs a bureaucrat i dont when these two are paired sparks should be flying and how however beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works when the other sniper hits its wits vs wits cat vs mouse gunman vs gunman and when the seasoned sniper is caught its up to miller to put politics aside and save him who needs politics when you a pro like beckett he took orders from no one but himself plays by the rules and not the book and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics the movie was a direct hit watch it rating 4 out of 5 stars
