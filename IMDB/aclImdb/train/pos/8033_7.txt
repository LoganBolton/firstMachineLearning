zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats i dont typically go for militarywar movies but this was worth my timebr br it was serious but it was also humorous beringers character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that hes got your backbr br zanes character developed throughout the film he wasnt just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gunbr br the ending through me a little though it didnt really go with the action throughout the film but im glad that i saw it nonethelessbr br its worth checking out
