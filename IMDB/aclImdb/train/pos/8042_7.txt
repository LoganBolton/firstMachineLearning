spoilers the film sniper is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos gunny hathcock the unassuming softspoken mister rogers lookalike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in namwhich shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really isbr br tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgtthomas beckett whos at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless since theres nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hitman backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his countrybr br the story of the film sniper is focused on sgtbeckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller billy zane being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze frederick miraglittoa and colombian drug kingpin raul ochoa carlos alveraze whos supporting him in a planned a military takeover of the country br br we see earlier in the movie sgt beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in sniper for it shows step by step how sgt beckett with the help of his spotter cpt papich aden young does his job theres also a subplot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva eward wiley who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as baitbr br what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambolike ending with sgt beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fogbr br sniper is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy
