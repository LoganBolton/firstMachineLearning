ive heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull i dont think they were watching the right movie this isnt the prototypical action movie thank godbr br this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people in this way it works extremely well with terrific performances from berenger and zane who doesnt sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles  he actually looks like hes actingbr br i was disappointed with the action towards the end  a lot of it didnt make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie but watch zanes face as he panics alone while berenger does the dirty work
