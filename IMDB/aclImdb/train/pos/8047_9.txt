i happened upon this film by accident and really enjoyed timothy busfields character is without redeeming qualities and at one point busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass bymelonis take on the parade is different from busfields janel maloney is terrificshe looks very much like tea leone but the major difference here is that janel can actually act some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when its on cable
