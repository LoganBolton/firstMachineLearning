one of hungs better early efforts the humor is deadon in parts as hung tries to imitate lees moves and facial expressions and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chans drunken master the action is also pretty good especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end its not the greatest film but pretty good for 70s kung fu especially if youre a fan of hung andor lee be warned though most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensivebr br sammo hung is a rural swineherder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys sammo turns on his deadon bruce lee impersonation when fighting br br this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lees enter the dragon but its not exactly that sammo is a rural swine herderobsessed with bruce leewho moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small openair restaurant once situated at the new job he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money when sammo switches into fighting mode he switches on his bruce lee impersonation which must be seen to be believed this film is pretty sloppy in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists and theres one character whos supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy and preposterous makeup but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy highly recommended for a good mood
