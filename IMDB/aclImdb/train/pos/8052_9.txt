this movie is not a kung fu movie this is a comedy about kung fu and if before making this film sammo hung hadnt spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati iie eg esp jour de fÃªte he is certainly on the same wave lengthbr br personally i think tatis films are hilarious but theyre not to all tastes some have told me that they loathe his work ive never figured out why but i think its because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan so unaffected by the events around him which he is usually causing that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around himbr br at any rate tatis main shtick  or at least his best known  is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios hes a hazard in a car but the worlds no safer when he rides a bicycle but through it all he never loses his aplomb which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overallbr br in a similar fashion the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there this gets him into trouble in small ways since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city  such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street a cop stops him only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt soaked during an accidental dip in the bay whats interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesnt understand what the cops fuss is all about  in a country town as long as no ones looking if you gotta go you gotta go in other words hung is not really urinating in the street  but he certainly would  and whats the problem officer of course hungs obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurantowner uncle of course in a bruce lee movie the thugs would be considered trounced and they would have learned their lesson but in hungs hong kong reality unfortunately prevails and the thugs return when hes not around to trounce his unclebr br of course hung finally triumphs in the end just as tati always did characters like this must always triumph at least in comedy because they are completely innocent and as such despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be we dont really want to be bruce lee who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the badguy we in our own innocence really want a world where lees heroics are possiblebr br unfortunately that world only exists on filmbr br ah but what if  and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best
