this is of of sammos great early comedy films this isnt a parody of enter the dragon the main character sammo is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble  then fighting oh the fighting good fastpaced scenes with high impact the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of sammos kicksbr br the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional there is a jim kelly looking guy one of three experts hired to take out sammo but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afrowig come on didnt they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978 well i guess ive seen enough white fakeashell chinese people in old american movies toobr br this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan
