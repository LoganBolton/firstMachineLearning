in the mid1930s hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look how they should be structured and how they should be acted the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialoguebr br this is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents for one thing many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative and were overburdened with title cards but what the informer has is the selfassuredness to extend moments between dialogues to focus on reactions more than speeches and to let shots play out simply for atmospherebr br director john ford for all his capability was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material if he thought a story was silly he just did it halfarsed luckily the informer with its depiction of community honour working class life and most importantly irish setting was everything ford loved and the result is one of his finest works in it ford only really employs too kinds of shot the first is of places Â– the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths cannot be seen dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us the second is of faces striking closeups against plain backgrounds usually without dialogue focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these peoplebr br lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him mclaglens performance does not look like much being as it is about 90 drunk act but the other 10 is heartfelt emoting as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity with such performances are oscars won mclaglen is backed by a spoton supporting cast among whom there are no weak links in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una oconnor usually only seen in comic relief roles playing straight dramatic parts for once although meeks appearance does contain one or two jokes the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedybr br rko who produced the informer were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios thanks to this we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable antihero at its centre which could easily have been a clunky overearnest mess instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world
