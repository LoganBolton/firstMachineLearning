even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film dont read reviews by critic theyre just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon nastill good movie this is the movie
