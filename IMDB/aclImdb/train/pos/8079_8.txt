not many reviews hence thought i would add onebr br do not go by the other reviews this was a excellent moviebr br rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good moviebr br ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting as does bhoomika too which was a little unexpected but great to watchbr br am surprised there has not been much hype around releasebr br or filmfareother awards nominations considering how good the movie wasbr br better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good moviebr br is a fairly long movie but definitely worth it and while watching it definitely does seem longbr br cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab akshay movie they always seem to do well together eg waqtbr br bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future
