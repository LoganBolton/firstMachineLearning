well i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that dont reflect my experience at all to me amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies he was a diehard villain a noapologies villain to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isnt sort of undercut in some waybr br the kid who played aryan was probably over his head with this cast there i think maybe the director could have done better but to be honest the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel she is an unsung heroine a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played virendra sahis wife she may be given little to do but she does everything with total conviction im sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audiencebr br so if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average you wont get much out of this movie but if you constantly search for something more then this might give you some of what youve been missing
