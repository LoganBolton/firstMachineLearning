its been quite some time since ive watched this lotr i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase bakshis work is quite true to the original work the visuals are engrosing and sometimes hauntingbr br drawbacks occasionally the movie is confusing or muddled there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl but overall  buy this movie its great for kids adults and collectors
