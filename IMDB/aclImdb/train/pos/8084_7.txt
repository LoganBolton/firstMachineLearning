br br i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night ive been a fan of tolkiens work for about 4 years now ever since i got out of high school i didnt grow up on this movieperhaps my mother kept me away from it its definitely not for children not that its bad in a graphic sense but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads overall the animation was excellent considering this was made in 19781979 i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense but i am bothered that bashki didnt just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts that wouldve made it the ultimate movie i was bothered by its abrupt end and then when i heard return of the king sucked i was bothered even more too bad it wasnt one great animation film it might have garnered a higher vote from me i give it a 7 i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr
