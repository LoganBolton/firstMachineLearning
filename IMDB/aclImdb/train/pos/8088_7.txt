i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv long before a liveaction version was so much as a twinkle in peter jacksons eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away and isnt that just par for the course i had the chance to revisit this film and found that it still stands up quite well although its not quite the success that memory had paintedbr br i have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jacksonlovers others as jacksonhaters im not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981 and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here  peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost noteperfect for the radio three years laterbr br i must say however that where i found jacksons films an increasingly indulgent disappointment the bakshi version for all that it has been cut to the bone is actually more accurate yes there are the usual understandable changes here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action the only exception to the latter as others have remarked is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell where the ringwraiths having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in midflight  which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river  then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop which is initially nightmarish but pointless plotwise and definitely goes on too long i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory due partly to bad animation and that gandalf windmills his arms too muchbr br but having watched both approaches to the film i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is halfmyth oddly enough one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorns story of beren and luthien the extreme literalism required by liveaction filming where everything from monsters to mailshirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera is counterproductive latexfaced or cgi monsters are less monstrous than sketchilydrawn shapes heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies and hobbits or dwarfs with nonhuman body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods with its crippled halfhuman movements as one of the scariest moments in the film  it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the darkbr br the extreme stylisation of the introduction plus a voiceover done with great skill and economy to sum up the backstory in a few sentences works very well to depict an almost mythical era and the change to the comicbook rusticism of the shire  i particularly like the proudfeet  corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkiens prose i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes bilbo seeming to become a gollumlike creature under the influence of ringlust at rivendell and galadriels famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits changed perceptions but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette  firelight hues at bree bright colours reemerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands  work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes where a liveaction approach simply doesnt allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised settingbr br as a fan i didnt care for either jacksons or bakshis depiction of lothlorien  again i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation ive come across of a beautiful slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time  and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria aragorn giving a hobbitfencinglesson here is as charming and equally uncanonical a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson versionbr br the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film viggo mortensens scruffy jesus look really didnt work for me although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to clean up the character in the second half for gondors benefit john hurt unsurprisingly gives a sterling vocal performance as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf the hobbits are i suspect intended to reflect contemporary youth as audienceidentification figures i find the animated style their proportions are much more cartoonish than those of the human characters works well to differentiate them and the whole hairy feet thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions including much fan artbr br personally i have less objection to boromir as viking  he was always a fairly bludgeoning type  than to beardyaragorn illogical they were both numenorians after all although i am clearly in a minority herebr br the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project with a bizarre tackedon voiceover ending attempting to resolve matters a pity it would have been interesting not to mention less frustrating to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith never mind the dead
