with the release of peter jacksons famed lord of the rings trilogy it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshis 1978 animated lord of the rings film as inferior i agree with the majority that jacksons trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkiens work but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshis ambitious pioneering effort jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshis film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptationsbr br the films colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive but these points didnt bother me very much however the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie the only character representation i was bothered by was sams he was made to look unbecomingly sillybr br this film is novel for its animation techniques in addition to handdrawn characters live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping it is quite apparent which characters are handdrawn and which are rotoscoped but none the less i found that the films style was a novelty the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out wellbr br the voice acting was generally of high quality particularly good was john hurt who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn aragorn isnt a favorite character of mine from the stories but backed by john hurts voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation my other favorite was william squire whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam whose voice acting was irritating and added to sams unfortunately silly image the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as arumanbr br in producing this film ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films hence this film contains about half the story from the start of the fellowship of the ring to the end of the battle at helms deep in the two towers the obvious implication of this is that the films story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations but the liberties taken to compress the story didnt bother me even the choice to leave arwen out of the story enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in 132 minutes the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helms deep were tremendousbr br ralph bakshis version of the lord of the rings isnt perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story however for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this first great tale of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel
