peter jacksons versions are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why br br firstly the acting of the onscreen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jacksons lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really sillysave for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jacksons party  even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior voice acting of the bakshis lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authorityaragorn the lordand with a seasoned rasparagorn the ranger this is due to john hurts brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensens rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven hurt beats mortensen hands down br br and then there is gandalf probably the most dominatingand the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalfwilliam squire is a real wizard and by that i dont mean he shoots bolts from his fingertipshe does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellens gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his swordas he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while im sad to say this the great christopher lee didnt bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and linesbr br before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jacksons pretendeous bad guys bakshis orcs taunt their enemiesor each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders  or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one  not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldnt do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering skybr br but as much i like this film more than jacksons the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated charactersall hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i dont really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just dont fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humansriders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownishgreen skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth br br biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway br br general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing timewith limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesnt do it in extensive detail compared to jacksons version br br in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superiorbr br overall atmosphere it feels more like middleearth overall voice acting music i really dig the fantasy score by kont  rosenman gandalf aragorn one of the john hurts finest roles king theoden orcs black riders elrond hes not some fairy hippie in this onebr br while jackson version is betterbr br because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects gollumsmeagol balrog hobbitsbr br lord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with its well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkiens fantasy world very well if not perfectly ill give it a score of 8Â½ out of 10
