my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king so i finally bought it off ebay thinking right from the start it was going to suck actually it really wasnt as bad as i thought it would be the animation was good for its time they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah woodbr br not the greatest adaptation of a book but trust me ive seen a lot worse it skips quite a lot of things since both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into one two hour movie definatley worth a watch kids might like but still absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy
