godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshis take on tolkiens magnum opus the lord of the rings has actually been made by peter jackson the recent trilogy to me arent even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the postmodern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping entertainments br br but as one who has not read the books i end up now looking upon the two versions liveaction albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way and animated albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework in relation to just the basic story not even complete faithfulness to the books and with bakshis version its almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what jackson really had probably final cut robbed of return of the kings big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointingbr br whats interesting too after seeing the jackson films first which i also slightly regret being that i mightve reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkiens book is given some clarity in this section the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf br br the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little facevalue for those whove not even seen the other films or read the books and cant put them into context but there is some level of interest always with the characters and here theres a more oldfashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more this is not a garden variety disney adaptation warts and all this is a bakshi film with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earthbr br and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its abbreviated form its hit or miss appeal along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation in some parts yeah it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in bakshis american pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comicbook form done in a different way still theres much i admired in what was done br br the orcs for example i found to be really amazing in theyre surreal surroundings theyre maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the liveaction especially during parts where there isnt battle footage thats really the real hitormiss section as there isnt continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback its creepy in a good way and the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together its almost something for artfilm buffs as much as for the ringnutsbr br so how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings i dont know to tell the truth its certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film ive seen the hobbit and ive yet to see the animated rotk and there is some real artistry going on theres also some stilted dialog an alltoorushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films br br if youre a fan of the books contemplating checking this out i would say its worth a chance even if its one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not as for it fitting into bakshis other films ive seen its an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement where as with lynchs dune its bound to draw a dark mordorlike line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who dont i dont
