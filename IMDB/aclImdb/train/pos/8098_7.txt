as an animated film from 1978 this is pretty goodgenerally well above the standard of the days when disney hadnt done anything good in years and tolkien cared little for disney anyway it gets major points for innovative and careful camera work applying cinematic techniques with relative success the muchmaligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well especially with the ringwraiths and the opening narration however it is so drastically overusedpossibly as a moneysaving techniquethat it detracts from the overall effect the same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesnt fare so well in the prancing ponybr br as for the adaptation of the story its actually quite good we lose little bits here and there minor details such as the old forest and tom bombadil the gaffer and the sackvillebagginses we compress a few characters such as revising legolas as one of elronds household and an old friend of aragorns but thats a rather wise decision for film in books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the elves and middleearths vast history in film you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way nothing critical is truly lost here and although i have minor quibbles about some of the changes im generally pretty happy with itbr br if only the dratted writers had managed to remember sarumans namehes frequently referred to as aruman a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarlynamed sauron it took me a second viewing before i was certain i hadnt misheard it its also annoying that boromir is a bloody stage viking and irritable from the start however gandalf is excellent and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent if only john hurt werent too old to play aragorn i love his voicebr br of course with the film ending at the midpoint of the story theres a vast disappointment built in what makes it far far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the rankin  bass crew on the sequel that they were permitted to do return of the king after butchering the hobbit remains a huge mystery they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling for all its faults this films heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task i can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision
