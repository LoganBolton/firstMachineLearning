i really enjoyed the reunion a lot i would have rated it a 10 if they had had hassie and little luke there wasnt even a mention of where they are today or why they didnt participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearancebr br anyway i was glad that tnn ran the series again i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series i may have missed a few episodes jenny hanahan
