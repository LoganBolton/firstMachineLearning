this film in my opinion is despite its flaws which i maintain are few an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of artbr br what mr bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films he does not receive 1100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience if it were not for mr bakshi i dont believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught what is more with the lord of the rings he has not only created a beautiful animated film but he has created an entirely new art form  unfortunately one that never quite made it off the groundbr br most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm no this is not disney animation no its not live action no its not cheating  what it is is a new fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as the lord of the rings bakshis pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way in particular the darker of tolkiens creatures particularly the nazgul are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplishbr br peter s beagles screenplay based very little as i understand it on an early draft by chris conkling is a very loyal adaptation of tolkiens works where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 34 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film but there are very few changes to the storyline there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled the reforging of narsil the gifts of galadriel the huorns at the battle of the hornburg but again with the time limitations he had already the longest animated feature in history these are certainly understandable though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequelbr br also there is the delightful one of my favorites score by leonard rosenman who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work it is bombastic and audacious and dare i say perfect it stands on its own as an orchestral triumph but when coupled with the images of the film it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people offbr br the voice actors are wonderful of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of striderbr br the character design is also wonderfully unique though not often to everyones taste but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what heshe imagines not what you might have imagined and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb this is perhaps not what you imagined but i can only applaud mr bakshi for showing us what he saw it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the filmbr br one farther word  the flight to the ford sequence in my opinion is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build bakshis artistic ability and tolkiens incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaledbr br the recent dvd release 2001 by warner brothers is sorely lacking while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format the package is woefully short of extras how glorious it would have been to have had a directors commentary been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the scorebr br of course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made we will never be able to see bakshis interpretation of gondor of shelob of faramir of the cracks of doom of eowyns battle with the witch king or gandalfs confrontation with him we will never be graced with bakshis image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead it is a shame beyond all shames that we will in the end have to accept peter jacksons glitz and glitter hollywood action film version of these later events in tolkiens masterpiece but i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at allbr br david
