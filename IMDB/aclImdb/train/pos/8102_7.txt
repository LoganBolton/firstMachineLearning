things to come is an historic film along with metropolis 1927 it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles it is also one of the first doomsday movies it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year and even in a subtle way the year it would end in the real world but then the film departs from reality depicting a world ravaged by war only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936br br the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings  later to become staples of the science fiction genre it is sad that after things to come scifi would become identified with cheaply made bmovies a stereotype that wouldnt be broken until 2001a space odyssey more than 30 years later if theyd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film things would have been very different in hollywood br br raymond massey and some of his costars play multiple roles in this film to good effect massey plays a great doctor wholike role as a pilot from an advanced for 1970 civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simpleminded warlord a very effective performance by ralph richardson ultimately the storyline covers 100 years but thats a big problem with this film  there really isnt a cohesive storylinebr br perhaps in such an episodic film  somewhat reminiscent of intolerance actually  its hard to have a conventional plot but i felt more could have been made of the material and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission  the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting maybe the producers were thinking of another future scifi innovation a sequelbr br things to come is a film every serious scifi buff should see at least once unlike metropolis however it might not bear repeated viewings
