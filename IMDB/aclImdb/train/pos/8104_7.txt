this is an amazing movie from 1936 although the first hour isnt very interesting for the modern viewer the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it however dont plan on being able to understand all of the dialog  the sound quality and accents its american  but 1930s american make it difficultbr br basically the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called everytown it spans from 1936 when a war is on the horizon to 2036 when technology leaps forward and creates its own problemsbr br the first one hour is a bit slow  although its tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought the events suspense and visuals are pretty lowkey in todays terms however when it gets to the future its just plain fun to watch the large sets and retro scifi look of everything is hard to beatbr br unless you have great listening abilities this movie is hard to listen to i think i understood only 80 of the dialog it could use closedcaptioningbr br if youre a scifi fan this is one of the genres classics and is a must see well at least after the first hour for the average viewer wait until theres a closed caption version and then watch it if youre comfortable with movies of this time period
