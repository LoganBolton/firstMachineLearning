i have things to come on dvd and its very clear compared to my vhs version the audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times br br i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found itit gave details of why some things happened the best things about the movie are the small things that i didnt notice at first such as john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party like it was a dive bomber out dateing sea power by naming a battleshipdinosuar ships sunk by airpower an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes swept flying wing planes strong rolls for the women through the entire movie br br there are more see the movie to enjoy them
