this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies br br the starting point of the movie was almost like episode ivspacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bonecrushing teeth of bantha who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark lukes jedi powers eventually finish the monster off adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo who was frozen alive at the end of episode v jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outsidebr br but all of the star wars good guys especially r2d2 had other ideasand those other ideas fended off lukes execution in the end most of jabbas soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to deathbr br like in episode iv the death star in episode vi makes its appearance as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star the star destroyer personnel i guessed sped up the arming of the main laser using the imperial fighters as a diversion the 2025 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise once it fired the rebel fleets only hope was that the death stars deflector shield was going to be knocked out and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldnt until the shield was taken out and it was taken out with landos increasing impatiencebr br like in episode v the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons killing at least one of the ewoksbut the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them for instance chewbacca as well as another ewok was able to commandeer one of the walkers and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkersbr br it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre like for instance the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike or in a climax using the sabre to break off his own fathers arm during the final sabre fight with sith vaderbr br you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks drumming on the spoils of victory eg storm trooper masks and luke finally meeting up with leia after lukes own nemesisdarth vader now dead is burned on a pyre the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy thateven with the strong respect of film composer john williamsbr br on the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending in addition to the celebration on endor he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death stars destruction balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies
