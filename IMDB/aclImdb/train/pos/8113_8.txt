this scifi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 visually it is a wonder to behold but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progressthis gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all timesraymond massey and cedric hardwickeboth great actorscome off as quite a pair of fanatics ralph richardson is very good as the the boss a megalomaniac warlord the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time im sure glad that war didnt turn out as it did in the movie there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movies different episodes although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would bethis movie sticks in your mind long after youve seen it
