the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement it depicts a space gunlauncher and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms its probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future but it portrays a childlike vision of boundless scientifictechnological investigationbr br to me it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozeanlike morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government the proprogress characters such as the two cabals believe humanity could live forever by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giantsbr br arthur c clarke author of 2001 a space odyssey suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarkes suggestions source clarkes special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies it has a beautiful menzies art design but mediocre special effects esp the toy tanksbr br i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happinessbr br cabal too much rest and too soon and we call it death but for man no rest and no ending he must go onconquest beyond conquest this little planet and its winds and ways and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of timestill he will be beginning br br cabal if we are no more than animalswe must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass mattering no morethan all the other animals door have done he points out at the stars it is thator this all the universeor nothingness quotes from screenplaybr br if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress then the council members of the world government will seem like technocrats but actually those technocrats allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely and they would have to be suppressed by government bans laws against science and experiment and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrantsbr br in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the councils developments of science and technology so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the councils freedom to experiment the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though only preparing its peace gas in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progressbr br so its also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as its about the wonders of progress many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias many want to ban cloning for example or naturalism some dont want us to progress freely and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth or fearreason some believe we arent ready for advanced sciencetechnology since we might destroy ourselves but cabal the president of the council has an answer to the problem of danger our scientific revolution did not abolish death or danger it simply made death and danger worth while screenplay
