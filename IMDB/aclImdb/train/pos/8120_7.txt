things to come is an early scifi film that shows an imagined world or everytown through 100 years you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the boss wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again after everytown was bombed and war broke outbr br this film only has about 3 faults its audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters arent deep at all and the overall plot isnt altogether solid the plot is lacking something that i cant put my finger on it just seems a little fluffy but if you love scifi and are interested in what hg wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see its worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing a long drawnout war because they were just about to go to war with germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everythingbr br things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once
