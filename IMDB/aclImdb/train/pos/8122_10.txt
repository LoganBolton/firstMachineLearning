i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year i was enthralled and entertained it has all the elements of what i love to see in a scifi story in a book or on the screen theres social commentary speculation and a good storybr br theres something eerie and amusing watching a 1936 view of the distant future of the 60s and 70sbr br i think its a must see and not only for scifiers
