aside from the great movie metropolis this is about the oldest pure scifi movie while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad it is a great film for two reasons first it is extremely original in both style and content even in the 21st century there are no films i can think of that are anything like it second for its time the special effects were absolutely incredibleusing matte paintings models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a postapocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow sure you could sit back and knock the film because by todays standards the effects are only soso but you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences in many ways the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 worlds fairbr br i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness the end result seems to be a little of both how truebr br a final note i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video all three times the sound and print quality stankparticularly the sound if this is available on a dvd hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning as the sound on the video kept cutting out i really would have appreciated this
