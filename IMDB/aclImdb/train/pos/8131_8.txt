br br if you like rap or hiphop watch this movie although its funny if you dont get the references as a straight comedybr br havent seen much of the much hyped cb4 but what i did see didnt have the heart that this little stormer hasbr br havent heard from the people involved since which is a surprise the film is very similar to spinal tap which is no bad thing and i think a lot of the dialogue while priceless in tap is funnier here probably because im more into rap than rock theses days so my own judgment does cloud that pointbr br the rap songs are funny as hell and its basically spot the reference for most of the film not all of them are inyourface which means the physical comedy and the oneliners get priority over the takeoffsbr br great fun one to watch twice if there ever was a movie
