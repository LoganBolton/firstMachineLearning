well i dont personally like rap but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious im sure i didnt get some inside jokes but some i knew and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after id stopped laughing im a big fan of spinal tap so naturally i had to check this out it was deriviative from this is spinal tap sometimes blatantly but this film still stood on its own as an original intelligent and funny satire my personal favorite back in the time of slaves they didnt have hats to protect them from the sun so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt now we have hats
