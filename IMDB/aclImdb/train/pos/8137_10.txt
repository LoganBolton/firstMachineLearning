if you like cb4 you have no idea what youre missing if you havent seen this film yet this movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody ive ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some oldschool performers definitley rent this movie there arent that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed
