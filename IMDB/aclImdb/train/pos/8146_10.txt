i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie this movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen the movie follows the exploits of a rap group nwh nirs with hats it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after its tragic break up following the group is documentary maker nina blackburn br br the movie is on a shoestring budget but it does not seem to matter this is a very well made well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent the main strength of this movie is the writing there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie it is unreal br br spoilerbr br there are takeoffs on actual rappers like mc slammer vanilla sherbert ice cold tone def tasteytaste and songs booty juice grab your dick etc rusty condieff has made an excellent film in the movie he plays rapper ice cold the movie does not quit it is funny from the beginning to the end br br the movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie like tone def telling a record producer when you take the bus you get there and the producer responding thats deepbr br the group portraying nwh has some sort of natural chemistry to them they work so well together and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film what really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is many rap groups had problems with violence with censors and like nwa the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyricsbr br i like this movie because it is offensive there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way the movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap the funniest being of spike lee where they came up with this dialogue i cannot imagine the movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor as i said before the writing is just excellentbr br i am not surprised that this movie met such limited release it is an intelligent controversial and even thought provoking film this is too much for mainstream despite the fact it is hilarious and nearly flawless in its production there are no major stars but a lot of familiar faces including marc lawrence who plays tone def watch this movie at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it
