this is a really funny film especially the second third and fourth time you watch it its a pretty short film and i definitely recommend watching it more than once you will get it more the second timebr br its like spinal tap but the rap version it has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films but its just a total ps take and isnt a problem because of the irony it createsbr br plenty of standout bits one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates and it will raise laughterbr br my personal favourite part is the guerrillas in the midst section great video superb
