im too old to know or care exactly what the difference between rap and hiphop is and being canadian its likely that ive never actually seen mtv but im not certainbr br but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it a bright little satire hiphop culture is so pervasive these days that its difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over if only we could say the same about bagpipe music i got most of the jokes at least i think i did sure its derived from spinal tap but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment just not the carpenters theyre sacred
