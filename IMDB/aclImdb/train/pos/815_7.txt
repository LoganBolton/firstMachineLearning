this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy for a variety of reasons however it emerges at the end of the day a winner despite all its flaws its still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installmentsbr br one problem here is the look of the film which isnt very consistent with the other 2 films i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz the first 2 films have that dirty livedin look with all the technology and so forth in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned this makes for a much less textured film also the creatures were excessively muppetlike and cutesy at this point it seems like the filmmakers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itselfbr br another aspect is its lack of originality where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps ice and clouds jedi lamely recycled the locations of the first film first we are back on the desert planet tatooine and then we are watching them face another death star maybe the emperor couldnt think of anything new but youd think lucas or kasdan could also we have these ewoks who really are just detestable madeformattel teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookiefight at the end of star wars if they hadnt run out of cash it just feels like lazy constructionbr br the most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time trading one liners with the droids instead of a real drama were stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke  as if the conclusion of empire where she confessed her love of him had never happened the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this films central story after his rescue ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances this is more like a 1990s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes lando an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle only hamill given an interesting development in the luke character is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor the film would sink if he had been too far over the top as he was at times in the new filmsbr br visually and in terms of effects work other than the clean look of everything its hard to find fault jabba is a very effective animatronic character one of the most elaborate ever constructed the space battles towards the end are very impressivebr br ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears but on its own it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas later productions
