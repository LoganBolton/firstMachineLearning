brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gorefests but the truth is that his films actually arent bad at all the reanimator sequels arent as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series and society isnt a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece this thriller certainly isnt a masterpiece but it shows yuznas eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging im really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didnt turn up until 1996 as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear  its running away from a tiger for the modern world dentistry doesnt frighten me but surprisingly i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife  pretty much everything most people want however his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wifes affair with the pool cleaner and his life isnt the only one as its his patients who feel the full brunt of his angerbr br when it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself however credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that im not squeamish about going to the dentist  yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with the dentist you always get the impression that theres more to the film than what were seeing it isnt very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level  and while this wont be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting while bclass is actually quite impressive with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie the dawn of the dead star doesnt get enough work and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast doesnt massively impress but all do their jobs well enough overall the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and i dont hesitate to recommend this film
