when i saw the dentist i thought it was very cool but this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes thats why it has its r18 rating its about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman its best to go to your dentist before you watch this but if you dont like going to the dentist already then its best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that ive ever seen who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist spoiler pull out all his cheating wifes teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic overall awesome flick but not for everyone
