i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site but i will defend this filmbr br the dentist is actually a really good film the acting isnt always top notch but the thrills are good and the storys good plus you see linda hoffmans boobies not that im an expert in this field but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense corbin makes a great creepy dentist it does to dentists what jaws does to sharksish it obviously had a fairly limited budget but they did well with it what they could and developed the characters well those that countbr br the end
