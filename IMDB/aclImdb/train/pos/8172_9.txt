i remember being terrified of movie blood when i was younger and gradually getting less so until getting jaded enough as im sure many other viewers have become so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm the dentist turned that aroundbr br the setup seems simple a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths and perhaps bodies as well a clever twist though is that the dentist is the films protagonist so instead of being some onedimensional bad guy with no clear motivation his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims and instead of hoping for justice to come to him i found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal lifebr br what really makes a horror movie is the violence and the dentist does it better than any other film i can think of first off the film has tons of tension which is something that modern gore films tend to lack in one scene  the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time as he reaches into the childs mouth you hope that for the dentists and the childs sake the encounter ends without injury i wont spoil what happens second when the gore does come it hits all the worst squirmy nerves once again i wont give anything awaybr br of course being a movie that youve never heard of it does have flaws most importantly its exclusively for horror fans also as another reviewer mentioned by taking place over a span of just a few days we dont really get any background on the characters and the tension drops a little bit during the very end but really the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgivenbr br its strange after years of being accustomed to movie gore to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood the dentist made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable and for this it earns my full approval
