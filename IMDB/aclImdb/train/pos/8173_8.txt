the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary its one of mans primal fears this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly nonlackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so its not really working out in a particularly gory scene we find soso actor earl boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when youre a killer dentist its a typical brian yuzna situation not well written but theres gore the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey its a killer dentist movie weve all thought of it but they did it first
