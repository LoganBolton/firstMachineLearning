the dentist is a really good thriller and pretty disturbing i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters vampires or zombies thats exactly why this movie is so scary during this film youll probably think about your own dentist a few times whether hes capable of doing such thingsyou better pray his wife doesnt cheat on him thats what the story is all about a respected dentist in la snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the poolboy  that must be the greatest profession in the world by the way poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work from then on our dentist dr feinstone can only thing about taking revenge he cant concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt things arent made easier for our dentist when hes chased by an annoying taxcontroller a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his at one point dr feinstone cant take it anymore now hes not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him the dentist is written and directed by brian yuzna and cowritten by stuart gordon you can take that as a recommendation to itself these 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies  and personal favorites of mine  like reanimator from beyond and society with the dentist they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller this film came right on time actually the decade hadnt brought us many great horror films so far im not at all saying this is a masterpiece but its a nice change corbin bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene i remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor but he can sure handle a psychotic character the rest of the cast does good work too the woman who plays feinstones wife is really attractive also it was great to see ken foree acting again the actor from my all time favorite movie dawn of the dead plays the cop in this film yuzna casted him in from beyond too 15 years ago and i thank him for that i dont recommend this movie to everyone if you have a weak stomach ill advise you to skip it but if you do watch it youll enjoy it very much youll be disgustedbut thats an extra reason i think its been a while since i was really freaked out by watching a film its a great topic to handle in the genre and yuzna does it in a great way too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel my humble opinion on the dentist  810
