this would have been so much fun to see in a theater back in 1996 there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker moviesbr br the dentist is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters maybe the ada launched a campaign against it since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for the marathon man which only has one scene comparable to the many in the dentistbr br its amazing to note that according to the trivia page the movie was shot in 21 days of course post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for the dentist is picture perfect the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist takes care of his wife theres only two quick cuts showing what is happening the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically off characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentistbr br for me the pacing of the movie was just right the film makers reveal the wifes naughtiness in just the right way all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office theres lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentists arrival meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown unlike so many movies of this genre the script is very very tight all the victims fall into the dentists trap in very calculated ways two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the endbr br definitely not for the faint of heart or the dentalphobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests
