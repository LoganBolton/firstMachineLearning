i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid of course being the blood thirsty gal that i am i had to go out and find this movie now i dont know how to put this without loosing credibility so im just going to say it i actually had fun watching this movie i know that its stupid not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome but thats what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares blood sex and crazy psychopaths sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out bybr br dr alan feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness on the day of his wedding anniversary he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man matt at his dental practice feinstones first patient of the day is young jody saunders there for his very first dental appointment feinstone begins to clean jodys teeth everything goes smoothly at first until he imagines that jodys teeth are brown and rotten his dental pick slips stabbing jody in the gums jodys mother picks up her crying bleeding child and leaves angrily feinstone sees his second patient beauty queen april reign alone with april feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars as she drifts off into unconsciousness feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife he begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair then begins to choke her april starts to cough and halfwakes up from the gas feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly rebuttons aprils blouse feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home later that night brooke meets feinstone at his practice he reveals his new italian operathemed patient room he encourages brooke to try out the rooms dental chair when she does feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide with operatic music blaring in the background he begins to pull out brookes teeth feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanlinessbr br honestly as silly as this movie sounds i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in hygiene that im sure hell never forget man i dont think ive brushed my teeth so much after i watched the dentist yeah i am going to warn you this movie is in no way for the faint of heart its very bloody theres stabbing gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans i slip it in my dvd player and thats the tooth lol i am so funny um yeah i try give me a little creditbr br 710
