this was an excellent 2part episode although i had never been seen the older ones i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal extra terrestial of course but not paranormalbr br this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans in a futuristic time would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossiblebr br being that its a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith especially if its also going to entertain american audiences but who care about what yanks say we rock doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 first being so harmless to scary from fun to serious from light to darkness i hope many old fans will one day soon say the old doctor who has returnedbr br 10 out of 10
