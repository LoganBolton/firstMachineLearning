this twoparter was excellent  the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films but what tv shows dont do that these days what we got here was a cracking good scifi story a great big really scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the ood  the best new aliens the revived series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters complete with a couple of unnamed expendable security people in true star trek fashion some largescale philosophical themes love loyalty faith etc and some topdrawer special effectsbr br i loved every minute of this
