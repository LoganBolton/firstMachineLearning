main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful locke is an 8 normally but with a deadly pistol in her purse cocked for the bad guys she climbs all the way up the scale to a 10 having been gangraped along with her younger sister some years ago locke as jennifer spencer has tried to block out the attack from her life as best she can her sister tho is almost comatose as a result of the trauma so the memory is never far from her mind one day jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in sf she buys a pistol follows him to a bar lets him pick her up then when theyre alone in his cadillac beginning to make love she shoots himonce in the genitals once in the brain   this in the opening scene ya gotta love this spunky lady shes got her priorities straight plus jennifer is a professional artist putting all her anger on canvas until now after executing her first perp jennifer curiously watches det insp harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy then she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street visits her sister in a nursing home then goes ahunting in san paolo ca up the coast where the rape event took place years ago with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist not uncommon to us right wingers when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal dont be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers  once in the genitals once in the brain throughout the movie scenes of jennifers revenge are interspersed with good il dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop remember go ahead make my day later on he threatens to step on a punk kid whod just insulted callahan in a courthouse elevator like hed step on dog stleaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say i want to have your baby my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughters wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel michael grazzo pantangeli in godfather ii does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don even if hes only in one scene dying in a mostconvincing manner however harrys troubles arent over with yet the elevator punks gang and threlkis henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two closeordered scenes and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly yup some of the gunplay comes off as uninspired screen violencelooking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie but theres only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets the punk kids die much more creatively though as they both burn to death and drown in sf bay warms my heart with so much violent intent directed at insp callahan his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the 22 caliber vasectomy killing as jennifer spencers crime is now known but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermonstothe chowderheadedliberals love that harry while our hero up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo two more murders happen same mo on a sleazy lazy fisherman and on an equallycreepy hardware entrepreneur then harry meets jennifer they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order making the guilty pay etc could a hot love scene be in the offing soon were led to believe just that characters abound in this realman meets realwoman crime drama and we get to meet a brassy bulldyke named raye parkins whos both irritating and entertaining raye set up jennifers rape for her boyfriend years before and shell get hers eventually the san paolo police chief played by reliable eastwood costar pat hingle the hanging judge in hang em high is strangely at odds with callahans detective work related to the 22cal vasectomies until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists much like jennifers sister chief jannings son is now a comatose adult but driven mad by guilt it cant end here though the dykes rapist boyfriend mick now a kinkysex jerk of a criminal drives in from vegas becuz rayes dropped a dime on jennifer summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions mick sleeps at rayes house but his timing is all wrong and hes arrested before he can spend more time with raye mostly due to the fact that shes since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifers revolver psycho mick makes bail at long last with jennifer gunning for him a desperate chase ensues as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other it all turns out well in the end with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song
