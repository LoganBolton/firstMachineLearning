despite the other comments listed here this is probably the best dirty harry movie made a film that reflects  for better or worse  the countrys sociopolitical feelings during the reagan glory years of the early 80s its also a kickass action moviebr br opening with a liberal female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums the scene which prompts the famous go ahead make my day line sudden impact is one nonstop roller coaster of an action film the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood it gets only better from there with an overthetop group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past superb direction and photography and a attimes hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s
