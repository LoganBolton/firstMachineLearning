excellentbr br goodbr br fairbr br poorbr br go ahead make my day br br the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself who was rumored of directing most of magnum force and he brings back the violent society from the first two films however the film still lacks impact and believability this film was released in the early 80s the time of regan and the young republicans the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesnt appeal to this time frame this plot would have been better for the enforcer which actually would have made it a good movie what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle br br rating 3 stars
