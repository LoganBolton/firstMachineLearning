sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion it was building up to be a great movie but then i saw the villains and was disappointedbr br sudden impact was different than the previous installments the plot went a different direction in this movie as dirty harry doesnt take as much of a police approach this time around we also dont see the villains until later which means less screen time for them which is better for us allbr br clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry enough said pat hingle was enjoyable as chief jannings harrys new assigned boss bradford dillman seemed to change his name to captain briggs here either way he wasnt any different michael currie is decent as lt donnelly harrys annoying superior i personally enjoyed kevyn major howard as hawkins the young punk who has a vendetta against harry albert popwell was excellent as horace harrys buddy audrie j neenan was good as ray parkins a famous lesbian around town jack thibeau was well cast as kruger a pervert now for the really bad part sandra locke eastwoods longtime lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer harrys love interest and paul drake was just horrible as mickbr br the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some partsbr br 810
