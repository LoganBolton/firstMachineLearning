clint eastwood would star again as the battleweary detective harry callahan but would also direct the fourth entry in the dirty harry series sudden impact again like the other additions brings its own distinguishable style and tone but if anything its probably the most similar to the original in its darker and seedy moments and bestowing a classic line go ahead make my day but some of its humor has to been seen to believe a bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts oh yeah however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san franciscobr br the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood hes ordered to take leave but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo where a murder has occurred similar in vein bullet to groin and between eyes to his case there he begins to dig up dirt which leads to the idea of someone looking for revengebr br to be honest i wasnt all that crash hot on eastwoods take but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel magnum force this wellassembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging its like hes experimenting with noirthriller touches with characterdriven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework his use of images is lasting due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics dark tones brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure harry with his new 44 automag handgun moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks its a striking sight that builds fear mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor it seemed to come off a major plus with these films are the dialogues while i wouldnt call sudden impact firstrate it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines youre a legend in your own mind dont you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip before pulling out his piece the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages lalo schfrin would return as composer after the enforcer had jerry fielding scoring bringing a methodical funky kick which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the getgo bruce surtees an eastwood regular gets the job behind the camera where he did a piecing job with dirty harry and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic momentsbr br eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harrys quest for justice by the badge even though he doesnt always agree with it i just found it odd a real change of heart across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke her turn of traumatic torment being senselessly raped along with her younger sister is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity when the anger is released its tactically accurate in its outcome paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j neenan nails down a repellently scummy and bigmouthed performance these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell a regular in the series 14 but under different characters how can you forget him in dirty harry yes he is bank robber thats at the end of the trademark quote do i feel lucky well do ya punk
