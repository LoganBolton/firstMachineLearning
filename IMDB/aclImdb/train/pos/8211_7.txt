having never seen the original dirty harry i judged this movie on a clean slate and i must say i quite enjoyed it sure some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish  but hey it was the 80s but even if you cant get past her and i almost couldnt or her revenge killings which seemed a little overdone p its worth it just for dirty harry or at the very least the bull dog he affectionately names meathead pbr br 710
