directorstar clint eastwoods sudden impact is an intriguing addition to the dirty harry series  a combination of crude filmmaking and genius its mediocre and silly in parts brilliant and classic in others with compelling gripping pacing there are numerous echoes of the first film here  the shoot em up make my day scene recalls the do you feel lucky one one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first films scorpio an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harrys partner  just to name a fewbr br harry callahan is still at odds with the higherups in the department still mean still tough but now hes older and wearier his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict  a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice the two things not always being compatible this incompatibility is the underlying theme of the series the first film posed a simple question what about the victims rights  do they outweigh those of the criminal vice versa depends that films answer was controversial prompting a sequel the highly enjoyable magnum force which set out to draw the line between harrys brand of justice and pure heartless vigilantism dirty harry like many of clints other roles is the personification of vengeance the protector of the the defenseless this movie however brings it back to the victim in this case jennifer portrayed by sondra locke who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her nowincapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men and one woman who committed the crimebr br without going into a playbyplay of the whole movie i will say this  i mentioned earlier that sudden impact echoes the first film  it actually also sprinkles in little references and injokes from the whole series the confusion concerning the captains last name is an example  an intentional prank i believe the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat  has our rogue cop hero found a soulmate in this lady vigilante and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sisters tarnished rights the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series one which i personally as a fan found quite moving that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the dirty harry collection the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film not to knock the dead pool  that excellent movie was a relatively lighthearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan rather than a characterdefining film like this onebr br this movie did well in the theaters  audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing and the president himself frequently quoted go ahead make my day
