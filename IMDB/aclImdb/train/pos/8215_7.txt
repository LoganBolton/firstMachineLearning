its a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a subplot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as starproducerdirector shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crimemysterydetective story in his dirty harry fame we get that make my day line and unlike in the first film where his do i feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here its switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus hes told to take a vacation and thats the last thing on his mind this whole main plot isnt very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the subplot that eastwood develops from the startbr br enter sandra lockes character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercoverlike getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahans storyline hes getting facts in the same small town shes in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwoods classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an arthouse sensibility has crept into eastwoods firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchablebr br its a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan doesnt have much to do except his usual its smithwessonand me shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and dont agree with eberts remark that its like a music video in eastwoods style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video its cheesy its hardedged its not up to par with the first two harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the 44
