with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars but produces and directs as well you know its got to be good although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series i completely disagree in my opinion apart from the original dirty harry sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences it doesnt get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good and its got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good in diry harry its well do ya punk in magnum force a mans got to know his limitations  and in this its go ahead make my day also in this film its nice to see a change of scenery as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series with great acting by clint eastwood and costar sandra locke and good directing by clint this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever
