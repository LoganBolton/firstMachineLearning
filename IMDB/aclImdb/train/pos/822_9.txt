the last film in lucas saga is a lavish spectacularlooking production it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy but i think it is a notch above episode iv and just a notch below episodes iii and v in fact i think it is the third best film in the 6part saga as far as im concerned it is still a grandiosely entertaining film it is not a movie with a beginning climax and ending the films mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind bring closure to lucas universe there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing which makes the film a little too sentimental but emotionally rewarding also it is a lot of fun new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges c3po and r2d2 provide as usual great comic relief leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo and luke is still a great character to identify with again it is lukes and vaders inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone lucas aggressive imagination is still very much apparent and the films themes of loyalty hope and redemption resonate strongly im glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii viii and ix because this film is a great bookend to a long fascinating and captivating saga not a perfect movie but fun in the best matin√©e style
