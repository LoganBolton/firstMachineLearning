who says zombies cant be converted into useful members of the community certainly not the makers of fido who take us to a neverneverland version of the 1950s where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class timmy robinson is the allamerican boy who becomes emotionally attached to the familys new fulltime domestic  a recently resurrected zombie whom timmy has affectionately dubbed fido all of this has been made possible by zomcom a bigbrothertype organization that has found a way to render the zombies who were originally brought to life by radiation from outer space manageable and docile  at least most of the timebr br this twisted modernday spin on the tv series lassie  it might easily have been entitled a boy and his zombie  takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre60s concerns as obsessive social conformity here keepingupwiththejoneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door the sterility of suburban life the corporate control of civic affairs small town corruption and nuclear family values  all played out in a beautifully designed setting of particolored houses and immaculately manicured lawns the movie doesnt hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs instead this is a lowkeyed subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than fullbellied guffaws much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community life magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled death magazine despite some playfully graphic violence the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950s itself and the cheesy lowbudget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decadebr br ksun ray carrieann moss and dylan baker are amiable and appealing as the wideeyed timmy and his cleaveresquire parents with slightly sinister undertones while billy connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpsebr br this is what lassie might have been had timmys best friend been afflicted rabies
