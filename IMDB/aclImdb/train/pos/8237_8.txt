for the life of me why did this film receive an r rating while it is about flesheating zombies believe it or not its actually a pretty good familyfriendly filmat least if your kids are age 10 and older unlike the traditional zombie films this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional valuesalbeit a bit twisted the language isnt a serious problem there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids much like the old tv show eerie indianayet some knucklehead slapped an r rating one it believe me most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only filmbr br the story is set in a paralleltype world while the fashions cars and mores appear circa 1953 in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the zombie war and massive changes in everyday life at school kids are trained in armed combat and theres a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack just in case as for life outside of school its pretty weird as well as people now have learned that zombies arent such a bad thing heck using shock collars and training they can be made into slaves who can do your housework clean streets deliver milk or in the case of a really sick guy be your special friendbr br this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave played by billy connally mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombies friend dad on the other hand isnt convincedas he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasnt yet gotten over this funny irreverent and uniquethis film needs to be seen by a much wider audience
