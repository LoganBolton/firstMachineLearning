i really enjoyed this movie the acting by the adult actors was great although i did find the main kid a little stiff but he carried himself very well for being a new talent the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk ie the nutty professor if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldnt like this as it is a bit slower paced i picked it up on bluray and i have to say the image quality is top notch probably one of the better looking blurays ive seen so far the extras were cool too they deleted quite a bit but thats probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didnt really add anything
