up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the longrunning series the varied action scenes and really different characters jabba the hut furry woodland creatures etc made this a particularly appealing moviebr br none of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laserduel between luke skywalker and darth vaderbr br another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of infighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page it was nice to seebr br in the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else
