fidois a very odd film and in many ways a very good onebr br my first thought after viewing was how the hell are they going to market this thing if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies doesnt exactly trip off the tonguebr br fido has little of shauns carnage gore  belly laughs it is a different beast altogether forgive the punbr br fido kicks off with a black  white information film that explains the back story  humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesheaters into dumb servantsbr br at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matin√©e but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middleclass nostalgiabr br young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesnt fit in at school his mom is wouldbe social climberand his dad is nervy and detachedbr br seeking to keep up with the joneses mom carryanne moss has acquired a zombie jimmy is disinterested at first but fido billy conelley soon proves a great buddy for jimmy until his collar goes on the blinkbr br fido is not a horror film but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it isbr br much of the humour is of the light family variety and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dogfamily momentsbr br yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark truly funny moments which while welcome will ensure an r rating for what is for extended periods a family comedybr br the film looks gorgeous and is wonderfully performed by all involvedbr br despite its difficult tonal problems i hope this movie finds a niche as its quite a little gem in this years deluge of cinematic crap
