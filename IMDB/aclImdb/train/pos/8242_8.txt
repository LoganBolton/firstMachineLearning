i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that ive become an instant fan the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it people were so naive back then that its frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works herebr br kudos to this canadian production the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast including carrie anne moss billy connolly henry czerny and the kidbr br its a shame this film wasnt a bigger hit it deserved more recognition its much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team oh well its an instant classic nonetheless
