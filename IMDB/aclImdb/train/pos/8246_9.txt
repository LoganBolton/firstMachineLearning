ok i didnt know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie but nothing about it really grabbed my attention but when i was looking around in netflix they were advertising this like crazy if i liked goofy scary movies so i figured to just give it a shot im so glad that i did watch it this was just a great movie it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch like i said its pleasantville meets night of the living dead its just a great concept what does happen after a mega zombie attack as we see in another zombie comedy shaun of the dead they have fun by making the zombies left over as handy citizens this is a very overlooked horrorcomedy movie i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot but its a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny moviebr br in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies this radiation still plagues humanity as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead in order to continue living normal lives communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants in the town of willard a housewife helen buys a zombie in spite of her husband bills zombie phobia their son timmy befriends the zombie naming him fido one day fidos collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor who turns into a zombie timmy kills the zombified neighbor when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor they capture fido and timmy helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing several days later the neighbors body is found and the murder is traced back to fido who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido backbr br i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it its so silly but a lot of fun billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought no pun intended a lot of life into the character i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed his last words to her were so funny you werent really nice but you liked flowers soÂ… and he buries her in the garden not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend sick disturbing wrong but classic laughs i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaveresquire type of world there still is a lot of gore in the movie so if you do have a chance to see fido take it i promise some good laughsbr br 910
