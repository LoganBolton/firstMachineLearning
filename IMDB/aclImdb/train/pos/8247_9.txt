as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out well i heard about it then i found the trailer after that thats when i knew i had to see it and i am so glad i did you want to see classic television mixed with zombies no then get lostbr br fido is a movie unlike anything ive ever seen well actually it kind of is its kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film though when combined it feels completely new and original fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido well this new pet aint no squawking parakeet or some pottytrained puppy its a reanimated dead guya zombie a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising which ensued the zombie wars though through the genius of reinhold giger lead scientist of zomcon he discovered that if you destroy the brain the zombie will perish thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war though due to lingering radiation whoever dies becomes a zombie which can be a problem especially with the elderly though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs especially with the domestication collar the collar stops the zombies need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia collars break old people die andwell ill just let you watch this incredibly unique flickbr br fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition with an allstar cast and great writing fido rises above most in the comedyhorror genre there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained though after seeing the film i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white at less than 90 minutes the movie doesnt go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate itll probably end up being a cultclassic of sorts since its not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie its a comedyfamilyzombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out but if youre still on the fence swing your leg back over and stay there 85 outta 10
