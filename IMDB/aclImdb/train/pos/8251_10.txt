and this somebody is me and not only me as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater why did the people love it its obvious everybody knows zombies by now at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the dawn of the dead reinvention or resident evil movies etc br br or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies  that is until this movie came along and youll see zombies in a new light perhaps this is not a horror movie although it does contain some violent scenes but is rather a comedy a satire to be precise and it never runs out of steam that is why i rated it so high pacing wise its incredible the acting is great and the script has no obvious mistakes  quite the contrary its a gem and if youre only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it and even if you dislike them watch it because its a great comedy movie
