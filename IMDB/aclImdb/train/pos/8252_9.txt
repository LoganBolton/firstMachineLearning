a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called fido as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in its limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including 300 of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie makeup and for any other locals who havent seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful thats right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950s emphasize on conformity and playing up the coldwar paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the deadbr br ksun ray plays a small town boy whos mother carrieann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own zombie father eventually the family does acquire a zombie named fido played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fidos confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brownbr br fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough undead carnage in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humorbr br the movie does break down in its third act its as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido 9 out of 10
