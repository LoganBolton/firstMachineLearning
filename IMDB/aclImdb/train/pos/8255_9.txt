fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these daysbr br as has already been pointed out this is hardly a real zombie film but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented feelgood 50s style i cant imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido  his fellow sufferersbr br while the cast is generally good i felt that moss and nelson stood out the humor is not inyourface but rather subdued theres a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema but it doesnt strive to be  instead currie succeeds in delivering a heartwarming black comedy
