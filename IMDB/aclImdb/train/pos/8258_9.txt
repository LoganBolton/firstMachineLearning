at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing im kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with shaun of the dead now given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius i realise this is a rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether fido will appeal to youbr br in a way the comedy picks up where shaun left off except were back in the original 1950s living deadera stereotypical middleamerican small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more welladjusted useful members of the community this so were informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom  a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps br br the beauty of the film lies in its deadpan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through  the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individualbr br its a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the films allround strong cast its one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part its also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been likebr br so in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you
