a long time ago in a galaxy far far awaythere was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released he doesnt remember first seeing the movie but he also doesnt remember life before it he does remember the first star wars themed gift he gota shoebox full of action figures from the original set he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be but years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts hes ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection its now legendary in this boys family how the last action figure he needed anakin skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years until he got into college trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets dont askits a northern illinois university thingbr br i cant review star wars as a movie it represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood theres no separating it in my mind from christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up in the winter my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth i was always han solo my friends dad built them a kickass tree house and that served as the ewok village they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yodas home i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to star wars and i think people either just understand that or they dont i dont get the appeal of lord of the rings or star trek but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucass filmsbr br i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time every time i put them in the dvd player i feel like im eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalkerbr br grade for the entire trilogy a
