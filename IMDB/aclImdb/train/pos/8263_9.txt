this film along with westfront 1918 are my favorite pabstdirected films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks such as pandoras box its probably because both are very similar to the neorealist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s this style film called for using nonactors just typical folks in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic filmsbr br in this case the film is about french and german coal miners so appropriately the people in the roles seem like minersnot actors the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the francogerman border instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine despite there being greater unemployment in germany this language differences illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factionsresulting in a we vs they mentality later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing risking their own lives they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in generalbr br the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen considering history though the films impact was minimal at best its a real shame as like this one westfront 1918 j√°accuse gance and all quiet on the western front milestone had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion so from a historical point of view its an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing
