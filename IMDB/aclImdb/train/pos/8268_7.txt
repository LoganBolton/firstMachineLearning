this is apparently the second remake of this film having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 and in so many ways it reminds me of the later film a yank at oxford both films concern a conceited blowhard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blowhard slowly learning about teamwork and decency in this film william haines is tom brown and his main rival bob is played by frances x bushman and in a supporting role is jack pickfordalways remembered as the brother of mary of these three pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes toms palhe actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clich√©s are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises however it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewingbr br in my opinion for a better silent college film try harold lloyds the freshmanits football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such as in westpoint and the smart set among othersand if youve seen one of these films youve seen them all well made but certainly not original and because it is just a rehash of his other films anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other filmsbr br 42508i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920 talk about overrated there are dozens and dozens of better filmshow this film got to be 1 is anyones guess
