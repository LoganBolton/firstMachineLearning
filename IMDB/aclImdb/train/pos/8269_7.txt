ive been intrigued by this film for a while in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb  a 90 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film how had i not heard of this film before this website well you cant always trust the ratings this is actually a very good film preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication  excellent acting by the principals especially william haines as brown and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvardyale football game  but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 obnoxious selfcentered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place becoming in the process a caring selfsacrificing friend i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels the predictability factor is high still it starts out very well and is certainly deserving of being remembered if not praised to the heavens maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard menbr br edit now 600 voters and the score has actually climbed to 92 seriously folks there is ballotstuffing going on here  i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than metropolis or the general
