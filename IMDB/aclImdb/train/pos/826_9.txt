im sick of people whining about ewoks true theyre not the best thing that ever happened to star wars but they did happen so deal with it besides they are cute and i dont care if theyre marketable yubb nubbbr br this movie always leaves me in tears its perfect the end could not be better im excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin i love how he is revealed at the end  it would be too unresolved any other way so those of you who are complaining that vaders helmet was removed take a moment to think about it its very effective vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sicklooking man he is not entirely machine  hes vulnerablebr br i dont know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope they all do so well they are believable characters hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development fisher does a fine job being a female role model i mean come on she killed jabba even when so many others had failed harrison ford  need i say morebr br the music is once again brilliant its so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie the best climax is when luke shouts nooo and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle john williams is nothing short of a genius what an amazing manbr br already the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i i cant wait to finally see it in the theatres can i wait and then watch the original trilogy yet againbr br bravo
