this is an extraordinary film that tricks you constantly it seems to be heading toward cliche at several points and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles it would give away too much to say much more but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded william haines is absolutely delightful  he is certainly a star that deserves to be rediscovered the gay subtext in his relationship with jack pickford is amazing  there is even a scene where haines rubs pickfords chest pickford has a cold both actors play this subtext subtlely and with great depth of emotion so that there are moments that are very moving and i never thought i could get so involved in a football match as i did in this movie  and i dont even understand the rules also excellent is francis x bushmans son ralph as haines rival for the girl yes its not completely a gay movie wonderful silent classic  a great example of twenties commercial cinema with an edge
