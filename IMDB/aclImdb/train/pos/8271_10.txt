one of the biggest hits of 1926 brown of harvard is a exciting comedydrama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star its patented haines all the way brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a manhero and wins the girl no one worked this formula like haines a terrific comic actor little annie rooney with mary pickford show people with marion davies haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines with lon chaney and west point with joan crawford where he repeats the formula mary brian is good as the girl jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate ralph bushman is the rival edward connelly mary alden david torrence guinn williams and grady sutton costar this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john waynes film debut as a yale football player but i never spotted him haines was a topfive box office star starting with this picture through 1932 its a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time
