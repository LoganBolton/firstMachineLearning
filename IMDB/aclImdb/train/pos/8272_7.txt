a family motherpatricia clarkson fatherjake weber sonerik per sullivan go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter they accidentally hit a deer while driving there this angers some of the localsespecially otis john speredakos and things slowly very slowly go wrongbr br i was expecting the worst when i started watching this the bulk of the reviews for this on this site are extremely negative welli disagree first off its not a horror film the horror doesnt even begin until the closing 30 minutes it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in on that level its pretty damn goodbr br firstthe bad stuff the pace is way too slow jake weber is a horrible actor way too many false dream sequence scares the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughablebr br the good stuff pretty good dramatic script clarkson is excellent as the mother some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot pretty good acting by sullivan only 10 at the time and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic endingbr br i think many people are annoyed with this film because its being pushed as a horror filmwhich it isnt so if you can ignore that i think you might like it im giving it a 7
