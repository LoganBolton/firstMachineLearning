if you want scream or anything like the bigstudio horror product that we get forced on us these days dont bother this wellwritten film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then its even up to you and your beliefs as to whats happening with the legendary spiritbeast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romeros tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out
