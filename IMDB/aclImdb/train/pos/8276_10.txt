now this is what im talking about finally a lowbudget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage wendigo while occasionally flawed is a triumph of the imagination granted it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness but its still a damn sight better than 99 of direct to video drossbr br the story is pretty simple a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo is it real is it all in the boys imagination is it an externalization of the childs emotional state br br some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because its left to you to decide dont be put off by such petty nonsense a film that makes you think is not one to avoid its one to rejoice in
