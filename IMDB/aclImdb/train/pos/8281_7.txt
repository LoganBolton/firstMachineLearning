from the first scene i was really excited i can tell this is going to be awesome i thought the acting was so good i felt as though i was eavesdropping on these peoples lives the music too was exquisitely unsettling the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward one could sense toward some irrevocable fate the build was slow but i personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesnt get derailed before its ready to pay offbr br so everythings going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling what was all i and my movienight companion could say if you understand the directors intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcriticcom but i cant help saying it was not pulled off quite rightbr br this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax in any case its too bad those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world but for those of you who dont write or make films you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestalbr br wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished but hay id take a blunted masterpiece any day over an overproduced piece of dogpoo overcompensated with too many digital effects like most horror movies these daysbr br one other comment some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing i dont know how to explain it but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent monster forms although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror moviei dont know it still worked for me in some crooked way i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again
