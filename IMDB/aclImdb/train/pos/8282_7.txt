possible spoilersbr br the biggest part of the movie that doesnt work is the wendigo and when your title character fails your movie usually isnt far behind it the filmmakers interpretation of the wendigos form is interesting and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly  when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror for instance  and the treeform was actually very good however as a monster character it never really comes to life we dont get much of an explanation for its behavior and what we do see from it doesnt jibe with either the story told in the movie itself or any wendigo lore ive ever readbr br i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isnt given enough to do in the movie when you boil this film down to its bones what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monsterbr br the cinematography is good though a little cheesy the filmmakers use scenery lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable making him the real monster in the film it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legendbr br i have heard unconfirmed reports from a newsgroup that the reason the wendigo doesnt do much is that when the monster suit was built it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves the performer had to walk on his toes that it was nearly impossible to run walk or otherwise perform in it thus the many flashes of the creature standing still and the obvious spedup footage of it running i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed
