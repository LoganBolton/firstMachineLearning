a solid b moviebr br i like jake weber his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances i liked the relationship between the father and son i liked the family dynamics the wendigo looks silly but it is a representation of the kids toy and the dead deer its an amalgamation like see this is a psychological story not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and youll be finebr br nice work
