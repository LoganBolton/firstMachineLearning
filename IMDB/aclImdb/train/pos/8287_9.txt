kim patricia clarkson george jake weber and son miles erik per sullivan are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattans bustling metropolis on the way they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along rather than helping at least one of the hunters otis john speredakos is mad because the accident cracked the bucks antlers george kim and miles are disturbed by otis and even worse we quickly learn that otis has learned where theyre staying meanwhile miles is given a wendigo a kind of indian shapeshifting spiritmonster token by an indian whom only he has seen is otis a psycho out to get our heroes are there wendigos in the woods br br i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers it is a fairly low budget film with technical limitations frequently showing through much of the film and maybe all of it is not really about the titular creature and perhaps the fatal blow for many people it has a very ambiguous ending with a number of questions left unanswered if you are discouraged by such endings and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant do yourself a favor and avoid wendigobr br personally i like films like that i usually prefer some ambiguity the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick scary creature flick where theyd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 the monster returns but thats not what this film is wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people heck writerdirector larry fessenden even has a character george reciting robert frost the frost poem and georges comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things is the key to the filmbr br one of the best things about the film is its complexity in a way there are four different films occurring at the same time a thread from each character in georges thread he isnt exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world and he has some parenting problems for him the film is a realistic horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse in patricias thread shes looking for rejuvenation of her life and family shes a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her hoping that theyll go away and get better in otis thread hes even more down on his luck than george and georges arrival into his life symbolizes the final crack in his psychological armor and in miles thread which is probably the most important of the film life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world but this is a horror story after all albeit one with a glimmer of hope and the events in the film give miles poetic interpretations a dark turn still when everything is said and done he seems to be the only one retaining his composure due to the poetic outlookbr br even though the film is low budget there are a lot of wellexecuted higher budget ambitions fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations and created some interesting slide show like montages such as the cards or the indian wendigo images from the book there are also interesting more traditional montages such as miles nightmare wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget filmsbr br other technical aspects are good for the budget the wendigo appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous the lighting was usually goodthere were a few times that dark scenes werent as clear as they could have been but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock it could have been digital instead or transfer i thought the performances were good and far more realistic if you value that than the majority of films although i didnt really notice the score it must have been okay or i would have noticed it with a negative judgmentbr br overall wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions as long as you dont mind having to think about the movies you watch
