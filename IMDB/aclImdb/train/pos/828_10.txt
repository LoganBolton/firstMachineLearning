i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 but that this one isnt even in the top 100br br this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this moviebr br the rescue of han solo from jabba this official wraps up the han solo in debt subplot that was established when we first met the character in a new hopebr br the emperor was finally revealled well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kidsbr br the speeder bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the filmsbr br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor led by han and leia 2 luke confronts his father  the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star landos momentbr br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think its kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each otherbr br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story
