as a 90 minute experience it is not up to the standard of drive as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the who am i academy while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat emup however those who enjoyed drive and i thought it was wonderful will undoubtedly enjoy this too you certainly wont rewind back to the start and watch it all again but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to comebr br  it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced even if not in hong kong and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen wooping and corey yuen kuei if you sit through the first half hour and arent sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat bosch is magnificent and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics kicks and simple acts of braverybr br  if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy then track it down and watch it its not shakespeare in fact its less articulate than coolio in china strike force but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team  im pretty sure theres no safe way to land directly on your head or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding carbr br
