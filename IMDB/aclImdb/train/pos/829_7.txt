i will admit i thought this movie wasnt going to be any good but i soon changed my mind the movie was keep you guessing as which direction its going pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly becomes burned out  asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help greg kinnear is an awesome straight man as his role as a mild mannered man from denver who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners mostly about sexbr br the imaginary in this movie is very well done especially at the bullfight scene  when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
