fortunately for us real mccoy fans most likely all baby boomers who grewup in the late 50s and 60s three of the adult actorsactress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugarbabe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but im not sure how there is no information about hassie on the internet that i can find very curious why they were not even mentioned it was so conspicuous their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself if still alive either 1 requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or 2 tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia like the rest of us they seemed to have vanished therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all togetherbr br otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done they made no bones about it  it was grandpa who made the show such a success i remember as a child mimicking grandpas gimp walk and my parents laughing as im sure a million other children did back then one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion  at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speakout and say too much during the reunion show unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me ive watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each timebr br dodgerdude
