guns blasting buildings exploding cars crashing and thats just the first ten minutes br br this actionpacked film involving a rogue excia mercenary who cant seem to die no matter how many times hes shot hence the title is pretty decent br br tough and toothy gary busey usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued after all hes carrying the entire show which doesnt mean there isnt a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith luke askew mills watson rg armstrong henry silva lincoln kirkpatrick thalmus rasulala and several other forgotten characteractors br br theres enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story busey has to free a group of kidnapped american military elites and return a hightech supertank a normal tank with a cheesy addon pasted to the top back to the states br br but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys this question is asked of course like in any film centering on the cia but without getting preachy
