this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it cant help but amuse and entertain there are tanks helicopters machine gun battles grenades and ice cream vans and if they arent good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best onedanny trejo and if you dont know who danny trejo is then you probably wont like this film
