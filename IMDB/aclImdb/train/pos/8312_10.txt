the life and time of little richard as told by little richard as produced and directed by little richard was about as one sided as one of his songs this is not a biography or even a docudrama but does have good writing great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard all the music is by little richard so it rocks a tight lipsync on every songbr br the movie covers his early childhood carrys thru the formative years in music the wild success and richards throwing it all away to praise the lord its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles whom opened for himbr br my main objection is that his outrageous counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time some of his energy which he still has does not come across full force he seemed tame compared to what i remember of him at the timebr br the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing to make the point about not having a decent place to changebr br if they had gotten into the bronze liberace as richard use to refer to himself in interviews then theres a story trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience his headband nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or tv appearance you can find little richard is always on
