farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her postangels career confounding us with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades but when it comes down to it theres no denying that this girl can act far from a story of epic proportions this welldone tvmovie is gentle quiet and occasionally moving fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her moms life as well as the funeral much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister brad johnson plays the love interest and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama but then theres always that confounding farrah to watch and she does indeed remain eminently watchable and yes i admit it i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when silk hope gets three and a half stars out of five on the corkymeter bosley would be proud
