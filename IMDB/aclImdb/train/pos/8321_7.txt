this is a pleasant film even if the premise is silly it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film another example is joe vs the volcano thats what makes her a star in part walter matthau of course had that ability too and he really puts himself into the role making an amusing goodhearted einstein i suppose you could say theyre both good at portraying loveable characters though loveable in different ways loveable young women vs loveable curmudgeon
