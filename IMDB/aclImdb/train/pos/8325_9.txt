i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly playful slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even betterbr br the story is pure fantasy but a delightful one an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be einsteins niece with the help of four fairy godfathers of physics ed embarks on a quest to win catherines heart throw a jealous fiancé who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology and eisenhower into the mix and you have pure funbr br the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous imp cupid with a slide rule tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal romcom level stephen fry is a joy as the rrratman and ryans fiancé who lacks a single romantic bone in his bodybr br the film fell below most radars but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings it features firstrate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world
