while fred schepisis iq doesnt really have any important qualities its still worth seeing walter matthau plays albert einstein trying to help mechanic ed walters tim robbins fall in love with princeton mathematics doctoral candidate catherine boyd meg ryan probably the funniest scene is when dr frizzyhead and friends lou jacobi gene saks and joseph maher try to make ed look like a scientist he ends up looking like a french impressionistbr br obviously little of the movie is historically accurate but thats not the point its not intended as anything except a light comedy quite the opposite of robbinss most famous movie from 1994 the shawshank redemption a movie about einsteins whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements but also his political activism namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the scottsboro nine and came out against nuclear weapons it got to the point where the fbi kept a file on himbr br so anyway this one is acceptable also starring stephen fry tony shalhoub frank whaley charles durning and keene curtis
