this is a really fun breezy light hearted romantic comedy you cannot go wrong with meg ryans cute perkiness combined with albert einsteins genius normally im not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people now deceased and not able to defend themselves but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this onebr br its the 1950sprinceton new jersey in the spring the story revolves around a pretty young scatter brained mathematician catherine meg ryan who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk a behavioral researcher named james merely because he has the brains shes looking for in the father of her future children however its love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed tim robbins as she doesnt think ed is intelligent enough her uncle none other than albert einstein plays match maker assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies all theoretical physicists uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicistnaturally with amusing resultsbr br walter matthau is his usual hilarious self and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively with his three professorial buddies kurt nathan and boris a lot of laughs ensue the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one outrageous step further if you suspend all logic you can almost imagine this silly story happeningbr br it might not be rocket science despite its main character but it is a wonderful sweet refreshing movie one of the best of the comedy romance genre
