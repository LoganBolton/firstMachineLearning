bottom line  best romantic comedy ever this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for the creation of a world and time that we want to revisit and makes us glad to be part of the human race when i am blue this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh and that is still true after many viewings  always freshbr br all of the actors are in top form the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor usually difficult to do with matthau robbins and ryan the supporting cast is consistently brilliant fry agae a total pygmy package jacoby  saks  maher the three theoretical physicists as greek chorus  but time doesnt exist durning something we can launch from nj shalhoub  whaley robbins boss and coworker at the service station and curits eisenhower  how many comedies have eisenhowerbr br dont miss this overlooked treasure
