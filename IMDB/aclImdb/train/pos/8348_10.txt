about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night i was 6 years old it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to dont look now in 1987 i went to venice on holiday the next year in silent terror hoping to god that my parents wouldnt find out id watched it br br would i have minded if my parents knew id watched les valseuses when i was a kid id probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays and my mums probably disapproving in the afterlife i dont know if theyd want to see it anyway from the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes im never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if its a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself br br its definitely violent it has a violent view of sex virtually no acknowledgement of love even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation but the scenario is very erotic and god im so british arousing do they suck her breasts for her own good that is exploitation so why am i getting a woodybr br the fellows go in search of an experienced older woman find an excon motherfigure i dont know it ends in a truly gruesome suicide i described it to my friend jb nelson who has cannibal holocaustguts and he went eeuurrgghh no motherly love for this movie quite the opposite mutilation of where the boys began why do they shoot the girl in the leg why does she come back to them do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from menbr br im thinking of two movies one of which i wish id never seen the other makes me wish it wasnt such a harsh world swept awaymadonna what a pile of insanity doesnt compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation once upon a time in americaleone god why does noodles do it destroys the path to joy weve been following him on his whole life so close to finally finding love with deborah now they are both destroyed why sergio whybr br there is no rape in les valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance of both sexes very honest no titillation no fantasy shags no perfect hollywood smooth moves jokes yes but theres too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy forget carry on shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg cos shell come back  youll hook her up with your excon lovers vengeant son  shell learn how to cum from himbr br two things i cant stand are rape movies and prison movies les valseuses isnt a rape movie god nobodys going to want to watch it now it is a brilliant movie
