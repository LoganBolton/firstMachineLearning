i originally saw this film years ago during cinemax friday after dark seriesback when the cable box was built like a keyboardand it intrigued me even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well actedthe performances of depardieu  dewaere are very enjoyablethey have a good chemistry together  mioumiou makes a pink fur look breathtakinga movie like this probably wouldnt be made in these politically correct timesat least not in the us since it seems to sensationalize things like violencerobbery casual sex this movie proves that with a talented cast  also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subjectit saddened me to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide  in the near future ill will check him out with depardieu  mioumiou in get out your hankerchief
