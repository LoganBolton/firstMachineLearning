this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series  it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies although his majesty mr kinski is missing you still have young joachim blacky fuchsberger starring once again as the typical clever american womanizer you have young eddi arendt in his best and just as well typical role ever  the cool sophisticated british butler  and you have not so young anymore lowitz as the melancholic yet very dry ironic and thus highly entertaining police investigator furthermore youll get offered a freakish and very campy evil guy behind a frog mask hence the movies title youll get a crazedout swinging soundtrack classic bmovie action scenes partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives please remind the time of its origin yelling scream queens and on and on all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness  highly recommended
