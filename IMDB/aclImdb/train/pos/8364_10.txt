robot jox doesnt suffer from story or bad effects i mean this was 1990 if you know what im talking about robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the 80s if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time it wasnt until terminator 2 judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized and story boarders began to use that motive but youll have fond memories of transformers gundam wing even power rangers if you watch this film the enemy robot is very menacing it makes you not want to face the man without a really good backup plan and there are some great moments within this film a traitorspy is working within their midsts who you think is on your side backing you up all the way could be the person you didnt expect himher to be and thats very troublesome to think so dont you agree
