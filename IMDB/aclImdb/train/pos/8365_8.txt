yep you read that right kids michael bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless transformers movies robot jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on megan foxs personal trainerbr br thankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert bands empire pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold warera politicsstereotypes were already out of date by that time just the bands luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh its still a pretty damn cool little bmovie they really dont makeem like this anymore or if they do they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportionsbr br for those who are unfamiliar heres the roboscoop were somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed disputes between nations are now settled manoamano or perhaps that should be machineomachineo by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots whichever bot walks away from the fight wins for his side gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series plays achilles the greatest robot jock in marketplace aka the good guys history achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the confederation ie the russkies the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgrens infamous turn as ivan drago in rocky iv the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finalebr br i hope im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isnt robot jox is just plain fun ill grant that it is a bit higherconcept than your average bgrade scifi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious greenscreen trickery it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empirefull moon pictures factory the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motionmodel techniques and the sets and costumes dont look halfassed in the slightest empire pictures and director stuart reanimator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2 hours feel free to rent a transformers movie by the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game if you want to have a rockem sockem robot good time pick up robot jox instead
