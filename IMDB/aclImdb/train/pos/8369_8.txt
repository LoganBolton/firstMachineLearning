hrmi think that line was from the old movie postersbr br this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator heres a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future is going to be fun this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to youbr br in this case in the future means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well thats never terribly clear but its probably something really important there are good guys obviously capitalists ie us and bad guys commies and there are big stopmotion robotsbr br sadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we dont get to see a lot of the big robots there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end the space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budgetbr br with said money now spent the climactic fight degenerates into and im not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks i can always get a laugh in a bar by reenacting the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their headsbr br like i saidits dumb thats why i bought the tape
