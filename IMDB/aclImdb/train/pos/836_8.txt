this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes however we are talking about a movie where a hitman and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldnt come as too much of a surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond a role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnans straight man ive read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing my father a consultant nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself
