note to previous reviewer this movie is sciencefiction adaptation of the iliad according to the screenwriter so whether the references are painful or not no apologies it is the basis for the film they admit they stolethough adapted is the pc termbr br great flick but too short probably didnt come out as well as the author director or studio wanted but pretty damn fun the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacybr br a bigbudget remake wouldnt be as fun and probably wouldnt do the screenplay any more justice but its fun to dream about the potential there a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i dont think it would play on ntsc players im no expert and thus still trying to figure this out for now i live with the vhs incarnation
