what a great film it is the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky the ending is not just a fitting one its more inspirationalbr br but i am intrigued by the characters it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athenas fear for achilless safety their romance is very enjoyablebr br
