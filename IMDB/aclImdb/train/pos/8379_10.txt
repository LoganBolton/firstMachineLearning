i remember this movie from when i was 12 it was amazing i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sht anyway the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch i must have watched it about 20 times it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off crash and burn dont watch that movie by the way it is total pants if your a real scifi movie fan then watch this if it was remade today it would be a winner i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it
