the matador is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straightarrow happilymarried american businessman greg kinnear in mexico although the sardonic julian ironically surnamed noble appears to be a tough guy on the surface underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless thus on his birthday he reaches out to danny a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julians unconventional lifestyle in fact both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter franker moments of selfevaluationbr br although the film is a bit too reminiscent of analyze this and midnight run to feel entirely fresh and original the matador nevertheless earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting brosnan looking aged and almost used up sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens hope davis does a fine job as bean dannys loyal and loving wife who like her husband finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and dangerous figure from a world far different from the one she knowsbr br at times we find ourselves feeling that the matador is holding something back from us not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise at the end it feels a little too light a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should this could be because this is the feature film debut for writerdirector richard shephard and he hasnt quite gotten his movie pacing down yet still one appreciates the fact that he doesnt always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laughbr br the matador is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully signal a new phase in brosnans acting career
