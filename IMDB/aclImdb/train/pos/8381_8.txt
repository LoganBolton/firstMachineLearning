this movie ive loved since i was young its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one cant interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our heros name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander hes shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel thats a just a little fact that is kind of amusing anyway great movie good story itd be neat to see it redone with todays special effects oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the tv show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated
