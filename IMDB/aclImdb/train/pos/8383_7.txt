robot jox tries hard but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together  robot against robot man against man man against woman the premise had potential but it seems the script wasnt really given the couple of more drafts it needed still it was fairly good for a science fiction action movie part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman for those who arent familiar with the name haldeman wrote the awardwinning science fiction novel the forever war its considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels right up there with robert heinleins starship troopers and john steakleys armor and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie rather than giant robots its closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoevens starship troopers which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based onbr br despite some assumptions this really isnt based on homers iliad a couple of names are all they had in common achilles having his robots foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad which didnt include achilles death nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior he was the mightiest but also vengeful and petty even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesnt fit he was named hercules while the greek iliad would have had heraklesbr br the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget true it wasnt comparable to terminator 2 a year later but that movie cost ten times as much the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in the empire strikes back and return of the jedi better in fact than a lot of ray harryhausen animation which is highly regarded but quite datedbr br dont bring high expectations into this and you probably wont be disappointed its better than a lot of other lowbudget flicks and even some bigbudget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts
