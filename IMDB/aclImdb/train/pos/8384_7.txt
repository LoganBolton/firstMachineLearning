i read somewhere in a fairly panning review that this is something of a liveaction mecha anime and i think theyre on the right lines i first watched this movie when i was very young and ive been dying to see it again and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back i dont think this is to be taken too seriously  its just a bit of good old 80s almostatvmovie fun it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future although this point isnt stressed too much what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didnt sound generic  no clich√©s no predictable lines  all in all just good fun maybe time hasnt been kind to this little movie but still i can find appreciation for it in me its by no means perfect but its entertaining and doesnt try to be anything other than that let the nerds and comicstoreguys worry about technicalities  who cares see it for yourself and make your own decision noone elses opinion matters
