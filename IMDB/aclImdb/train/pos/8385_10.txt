this film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason probably just by the mass populace anyhow this is actually a very interesting movie the film is an underbudget scifi movie which actually works due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes br br this movie may not be for everyone though if there are any scifi fans reading this i truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction the film has crazy ideas the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries invest all its money in the world has been divied up into territories anyone can challenge anyone else to a war or rather a robotduel the method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war since now everyone is wearing those breath masks definetly a movie that makes you think intelligent well written and good effects for the measly budgetbr br i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work
