12 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis adam scott philip baker hall directed by richard shepardbr br a well formulated story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies after 2004s after the sunset his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time professional hitman so to speak julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright kinnear possibly one of his best roles also on business there the two onscreen duo produce a comically charged laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs davis in one of her best roles since american splendor gives another charming and witty performance one of the years most enjoyable and best films my final rating 910
