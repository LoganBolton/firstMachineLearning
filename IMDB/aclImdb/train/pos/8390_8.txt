my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema small hall with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while filmrolls were changed  were perfect matchbr br there were many cliches used in the film but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing sound was also brilliant sometimes back being louder than dialoguebr br everything seemed to be in right place and i loved the way how afterwartime was presented real funbr br
