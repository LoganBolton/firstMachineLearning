the marriage of maria braun mmb is about a german girl maria getting married to a german soldier herman braun just at the ending of the war after being married for half a day and a night herman is send to the front again to make ends meet maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier she got word that herman died at the front and things develop between her and the american soldier herman walks in on them in bed and after a confrontation between him and the american maria killed the american herman admits to the murder ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him the country is in shambles one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette there are food shortages it is in short a time of survival of the fittest br br basically this film projects marias attitudes  those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances as a metaphor for germanys loss of soul after they lost the war and how it proceeds to rebuild itself for example maria has the following conversation with a peddler played by fassbinder himself the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that kleist burns out to quickly it does not provide enough heat for the cold the peddler answers thats another way to look at it right now its probably the correct way br br maria meets a frenchgerman business man karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment she decides to get involve with karl youre not having an affair with me im having an affair with you she also takes responsibility in the company and after a while has the complete trust of the firm when karl says i suppose well just have to wait for a miracle she replies i prefer making miracles  then wait for them in her own words she has become the mata hari of the economic miraclebr br in a lot of fassbinders films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms see freud in other words he liked pointing his camera at the bullsht the false social mechanisms the pretending the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology for example she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point i need someone to sleep with as fassbinder said the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society he also remarked that his films are anti emotional br br i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant apparently frequently visited by hitler himself maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side as if marias brutal honesty wears him out as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore karl says i have to tell myself over and over that i love life maria replies thats life isnt it as if we signed a contract to enjoy life and then we go out to eat and talk about food i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships to never submit completely to anyone and why would you if the central matter of most of his films is about what love becomes in this society  a commodity an instrument of power a weaponbr br it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war  with these clothing essentially the wrong period what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great but fassbinder was not interested in perfection any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project since he completed films approximately 4 a year the way other people rolled cigarettes it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes peter marthesheimer who wrote most of the script mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park overnight br br hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria mostly she just stares bluntly into the camera in marias own words it is a bad time for emotions but i like it like that br br there are different opinions about the end after karl died of a hart attack herman finally shows up herman left for australia after he got out of prison to become human again after the testament is delivered made out to her and herman in half maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette and blow her and herman up for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident at the same time she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore she felt as if she had outlived herself
