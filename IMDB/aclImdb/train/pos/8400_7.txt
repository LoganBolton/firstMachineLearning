i picked this film up at my local library having met the director at a film festival late last year i was curious to check out his work i was pleasantly surprisedbr br the film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects love infidelity friendships jealousy it can be a bit talky at times but never so much as to completely sink the film i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly falling into something as important as lovebr br the contrast between this film and the average lowbudget shootem up black film is quite distinct check it out if youre lucky your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did good stuff
