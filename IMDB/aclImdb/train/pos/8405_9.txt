i am proud to say i own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70s crown international drivein sexploitation comedy cheese on dvd its a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezyneasy 70s vibe to it it does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail sure its essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic  the main teen goofus character bobby hamilton gets the girls the respect of his friends and a chance to showup a local vanracing bully  but its way too dopey and goodnatured to hate stuart getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead deborah white as the main object of getzs affection is a definite cutie connie lisa marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe and sneering beefcake neanderthal stephan oliver a 60s biker movie perennial is wonderfully hateful as the brutish dugan hicks a prestardom danny devito in particular is an absolute riot as getzs cranky carwash owner boss andy a lovably cantankerous neerdowell slob who wears very ugly loud hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit i especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat danny up  one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over dannys torso and sammy johns insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week in short its great groovy retro70s fun
