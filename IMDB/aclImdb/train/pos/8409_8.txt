a good film and one ill watch a number of times rich the previous commenteris right there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation were there more in the original or was a nativelanguage audience expected to lipread more or  since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based  was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar in short very worth a look but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into itbr br the alpha video release touts the new organ score but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way sure it starts promisingly but degenerates into a repetitive phillipglasslike monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen after listening for a while i turned off the sound and simply watched much better
