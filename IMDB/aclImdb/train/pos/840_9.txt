wasnt sure what to expect from this film i love watching brosnan in any movie hes always good but this was totally different hes a mess and plays being a mess very well in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni  so yes theres not a lot of violence theres not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and its pretty funny too  i dont think youll come out of the cinema going wow i was blown away but youll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film cant ask for more than thatbr br oh and if youre lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and youll get inverted upside down reversed with reversed audio adverts brilliant nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american twin peaks commentary
