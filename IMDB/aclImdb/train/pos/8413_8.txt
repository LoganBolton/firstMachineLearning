a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a womanso obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the ladys heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants thats within their room the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the mans reflection out of the mirrorand bad things naturally occur as a resultbr br if this film had been made just a decade later i am sure i wouldnt have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film after all the films plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is at times a bit stilted however when you consider that in 1913 fulllength films were rareand often only 20 to 30 minutes long plus the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusualas stories were very short and broadly acted so given the limitations of the time this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known
