while this movies style isnt as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead emil janningsbr br jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting callto play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution naturally this isnt much of a stretch actingwise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolutionbr br exactly what happens next ill leave to you but its a pretty good filmparticularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in 1928 with the makeup he doesnt look much younger than he did in many of his later films
