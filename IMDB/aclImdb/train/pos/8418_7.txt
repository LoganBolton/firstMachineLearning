russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928 william powell is casting his epic about the russian revolution and hires an old exgeneral from the czarist regime emil jannings to play the general of the film and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared evelyn brent of 11 years beforebr br try as i might i feel it hard to warm to the last command for all its virtues the docks of new york was indubitably a great film and underworld is a film i have always been craving to see but the last command is rather heavygoing the premise is fascinating but the treatment does really make the script come to life except in the sequences set in hollywood depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with stateoftheart technologybr br emil jannings is predictably a marvelous russian general distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old exgeneral transfixed in his misery and the vigorous hearty officer of yorebr br the ending is great and worth the wait but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times
