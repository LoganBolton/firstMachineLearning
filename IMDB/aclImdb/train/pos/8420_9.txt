1927 and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade now that it had become the site of a multimillion dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established some of those in the calmer quarters of this filmmaking factory were taking the time for a little selfreflection the last command while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal it was written by lajos biro who had been on the scene long enough to knowbr br taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywoods most celebrated immigrants Â– emil jannings before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy being a master of the hammy yet hilariously welltimed performance often as pompous authority figures or doddering old hasbeens he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter and at first it looks as if this is to be another of janningss scenerychomping caricatures however as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range showing by turns delicate frailty serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performancebr br the director was another immigrant albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister the von was made up by the way and took a very distinctive approach to the craft of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes we open with a carefullyconstructed chaos with movement in converging directions which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen then when jannings arrives everything settles down janningss performance is incredibly sedate and measured and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored orderbr br sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic in fact he really seems to have an allround lack of interest in action in the scene of the prisoners revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance his camera eventually retreating to a flyonthewall position compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent which are a complex medley of pointofview shots and intense closeups thrusting us right into the midst of their interactionbr br as a personality on set it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell and in fact powells portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically it appears noone told his costars they were not in a comedy evelyn brent is fairly good giving us some good emoting but overplaying it here and there the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself its a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless like a male ninotchka but he does a good job revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hardhearted exteriorbr br the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the filmmaking process even a relatively tame example like this at the very least i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the behindthescenes view as it threatened the mystique of moviemaking which was still very much alive at this point as it turned out such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and according to some sources although the issue is a little vague a nomination for best picture this is significant since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of selfindulgent backslapping by the hollywood elite but elite or not they recognised good material when they saw it and were willing to reward it
