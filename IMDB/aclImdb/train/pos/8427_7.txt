this is one of the oddest films of the zat么ichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film interestingly enough this was the first zat么ichi film made by shintaro katsus new production company now instead of just playing the blind swordsman katsu is in charge of making the films this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films as far as ichis role the film is very different because he isnt in the film as much as usual hes also easy to fool and actually for a while does a lot to harm people instead of helping br br zat么ichi r么yaburi begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness oddly in this scene ichi says that hes been blind since a toddler though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8 this is a minor mistake and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticedbr br this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a yearso you can see what i said about odd pacing most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks ichi comes to a town where there is a boss asagoro who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind mans reputation the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man at the same time he meets another boss shushuia sort of guru to the poor shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teachinggiving up his blade for many months shushuis teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from chinanonviolence and acceptance of life as it is for good or for bad br br months after leaving this town and thinking all was well ichi learns that as soon as he left asagoro showed his true colorsenslaving women oppressing the poor and being an allaround jerk in a way ichi is responsible for this as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend now asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss actionsbr br when ichi returns he doesnt accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where what else ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui this finale was very good and occurred in the rain then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great though the beheading is a tad cheesy by todays special effects standardsbr br pluses for the film are that although poorly paced it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 which often seem very similar additionally it does end very well minuses aside from pacing are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flatvery very very flat they are tacky and unfunnythats the sort of flat that it is
