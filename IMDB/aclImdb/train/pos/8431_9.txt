 havent seen this film havent even heard of this film it wouldnt surprise me one of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution the independent company kino films gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didnt even bother reviewing it i guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in todays market  and its the intelligent filmlovers lossbr br for the record both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations as did the cinematographer but the film received such little fanfare that i cant even blame the academy on that one this is a film that is challenging thoughtprovoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on its own terms taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment director john berry wisely does not attempt to dressup athol fugards play sure were given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots but the film version of boesman and lena remains on the whole a story of two people living in inhumane conditionsbr br stripped of their basic human rights boesman glover and lena bassett have no one left to attack but each other a third character joins them for awhile willie jonah amazing in a largely silent role but the films focus never strays from the title characters and what theyve become bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon vigorously and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video hands down the best film of the year 2000
