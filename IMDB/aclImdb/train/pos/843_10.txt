not to mention easily pierce brosnons best performance of course greg kinnear is always great really when has he really been bad i think this film is incredibly underrated the use of colors in this movie is something very different in todays film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter i also love the way they used the song by asia proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctlybr br i was making my first feature when this came out being that my film was a hitman movie i had to check out anything in the genre that was released after seeing it im sure it had some effect on me through the process it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidencebr br httpwwwimdbcomtitlett1337580
