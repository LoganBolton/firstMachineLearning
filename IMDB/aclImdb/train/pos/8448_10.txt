i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldnt waitbr br let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television ive ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an alltogether great show
