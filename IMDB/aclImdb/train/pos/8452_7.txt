overpowered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies  check weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything  check mobile suits based on angels  checkbr br ok  its a gundam series this one gundam wing has good character development realworld complexity interesting ideas and some pretty eyecandybr br with characters the initially weak relena dorlan later peacecraft then back to dorlan gets stronger and more independent although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy the series main character the aforementioned heero initially a cold hard butcherer becomes more and more human while still remaining incharacter and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise float between oz freelance and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creationsbr br the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good  reflecting how the real world works however in 49 halfhour episodes it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isnt used to its full potentialbr br the ideas at the core of the series  the necessity of fighting the desire for peace etc  are ones that resonate even today in retrospect the series was ahead of its time what with the war on terrorism and all but its exploration of these ideas the monologues especially those of treize kushrenada is an incredible dramatic piece forming some of the best writing in the seriesbr br but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edgebr br in terms of eyecandy which is what this one has in bucketloads everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra no not the tampons you idiot is wells designed and explodes in big balls of orange which is bad because better animation wouldve had better explosions but who cares stuff explodes and thats all that mattersbr br in short though the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes youve missed out on a lot the poor writing can leave you cringing and sometimes the animation makes you go wtf but this is made up for in its classic animation style its scale sparks of incredible dialogue and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations
