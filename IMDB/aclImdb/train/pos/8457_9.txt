gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime a bit slow moving especially around the middle of the series but over all enjoyable now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a winger i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam gundam 0080 and 0083 the 08th ms team and gundam seedbr br i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be ripoffs ie zechs marquise to the original gundams char but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series as is seedbr br if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first and then know that you are watching an au series
