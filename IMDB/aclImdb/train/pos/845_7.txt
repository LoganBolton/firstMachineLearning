the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it it seems so light the humor is always mediumgauge never unfunny but never gutbusting the story is a very simple thread the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straightlaced glasswearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each others lifestyles i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time it wasnt it has a subtle way of connecting with the audiencebr br i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though its a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know forget calling them real thats not at all what i mean what i mean is that though pierce brosnans filthy womanizing boozing hit man is a detached comical character hes grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air greg kinnears character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness but hes given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the films lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes trains and automobiles told stalely over again its truly saying somethingbr br the films climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists but with its lightness how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other strangely the matador is a film about regret and loneliness brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we dont understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life its slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more downtoearth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption the very last scene of the movie stays with me it i think is where the films subtle sidestepping impact finally begins to seep
