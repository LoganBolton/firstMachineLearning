i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the storytelling i am still a fanwith some minor painsbr br though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series hada stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everythingsound familiar i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellowdramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to bellyache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plansespecially the character called wufeii mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera get a counselorwill yabr br besides for the overexaggerated dramai think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again i mean it can always be worse it could be like the recent installment seedeeeewwww talk about mellowdramaticill chat about that one later
