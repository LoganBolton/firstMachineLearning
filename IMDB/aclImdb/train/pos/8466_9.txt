like talk radio the booth is actually kinda predictable talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in the booth because of lets face it the genre and the basic setup thats not necessarily a bad thing in this case it means in essence that the filmmakers dont punk out in the end the way they mightve in say an american version of this story the booth moves inexorably toward its foregone conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a welltravelled stretch of very scenic road it reminds me of harlan ellisons spooky short story flop sweat the claustrophobia is at times almost palpable worth a nice long look
