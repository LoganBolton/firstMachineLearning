two years ago i watched the matador in cinema and i loved everything about this movie obviously i was totally under impression of pierce brosans magnificent role yesterday i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper now i can say with certain that this movie isnt that special but you just gotta love it because of one man br br brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble tired hitman who has no friends soon julian meets danny wright greg kinnear in mexico city man whos got bad luck his son died in accident his job isnt going that well and hes not sure that he can keep his wife bean hope davisbr br i always liked movies like this crime movie with big touch of humor mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d or one of my favorite lines in this movie i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning after the navys left town brosnan says it with his charm while hes drinking his margarita as usually i also like greg typical american face kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wrightbr br so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever hell make you smile and admire him at the same time great brosnan in not equally great movie
