a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the crown of the queen of sheeba from egypt the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco but it wont be an easy journey there are plenty of wouldbe thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown fortunately for all involved mr moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey however that doesnt mean someone wont try to get their hands on the treasurebr br after the disappointment of mr motos gamble i went into mr moto takes a vacation hoping for the best but admittedly fearing the worst but within the first 10 seconds of the film i knew i would find it more enjoyable im a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist imagine that peter lorre playing a german the beginning scenes really drew me in while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco it remained just as enjoyable dark sinister characters lurking in the rainy night gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the heros head sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love and mr moto takes a vacations got em all a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role comic relief from gp huntley thats actually funny and a return to form for mr moto ive already mentioned his disguise in the movies opening scenes well the athletic moto comes out near the films finale moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey all this and i havent even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre any way you look at it mr moto takes a vacation is a winnerbr br as much as i hate that the mr moto series had to end after this installment its understandable when you think about it wwii was just around the corner and after pearl harbor a movie with a japanese hero wouldnt have gone over very well at least the mr moto series ended on a very positive note
