i totally disagreei thought that this was a great movie for kidsdawn wells from gilligans islandand promise shown of a barely then known dana platoit was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluffno it wasnt scary and wasnt meant to bei wont ruin the endingbut it was unusual the way that it was donei mean the kids characters were great and i didnt know what to expect in the endthe basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initiallyit also helps them out of a jam towards the endit also has the plus of not being overly longi think it clocks in at under 95 minutes
