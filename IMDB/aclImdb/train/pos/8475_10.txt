this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i dont know why they called it return to boggy creek as if its a sequelthis movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid yes its very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 812 yo group which it targeted its harmless grated kiddie fare and at least you dont have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it strictly for the 812 yo set older kids will get bored and think it lame
