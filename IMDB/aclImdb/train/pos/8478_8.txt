i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual  a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child
