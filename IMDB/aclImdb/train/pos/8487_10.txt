i remember watching gung ho as a child with my mother and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes i of course found the entire movie hilarious particularly the mannerisms of the characters it wasnt until i was much older and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually isbr br michael keaton and gedde watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators keaton ceases to amaze me with his reallife style of line delivery and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix i also thought that patti yasutake umeki was simply fabulous in her role as the comic reliefbr br i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese workers in this filmsometimes you really can have the best of both worlds and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments id rather have one of those cars too
