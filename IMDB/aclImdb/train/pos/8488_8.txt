i just have to throw my two cents in relax its a comedy yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted i cant think of many comedies where they arent this isnt a new release its out on video and airs on cable almost every week would i see it in a theater sure i did when it first came out its funnythat should be enoughbr br even if i didnt like it at all id still watch it on cable for michael keaton hes an underrated and underappreciated actor i cant think of another who is so capable in every genre nor can i think of one whos as successful a comedic actor whos also an action starshort lived but still whos also a romantic lead whos also a dramatic actor a villain and a hero i cant think of any at least not in hollywood certainly none who have been successful at all those genres i mean theres tom cruise but to me hes better at being tom cruise than becoming a character however this isnt about michael keaton vs tom cruise so ill move onbr br gung ho is worth renting heck its worth buying since you can probably find it for 1000 or less at stores like walmart its worth watching on cableif you have cable or satellite its one of those fun to watch movies you can put your brain on pause and just relax and chuckle awaybr br to ask for more in my honest opinion is asking too much
