way way back in the 1980s long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities the united states and japan were at each others throat in the world manufacturing race remember sayings like union yes the japanese are taking this country over and americans are lazybr br as the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash gung ho which drew over 36 million in us box office receipts while in many ways dated howards tongueincheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life todaybr br gung ho focuses on hunt stevenson michael keaton the automakers union rep from hadleyville a small depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo similar to reallife toyota which is considering a us operation at the towns empty plant with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly linebr br the 112 minutes of gung ho is a humorous look at these two sides with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered on one hand an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism on the other hand japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of selfworth in stevenson we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings with the survival of his workers jobs and most of hadleyville on the line stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble besides answering to the heads of assan we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members many of whom he grew up with this includes buster george wendt willie john turturro and paul clint howard rons brotherbr br the japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe also known for sixteen candles and volunteers watanabe plays kazihiro the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life he is constantly shadowed by saito sab shimono the nephew of assans ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order while given a light touch these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culturebr br with hunt stevenson dominating the script michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work gung ho is indeed a slamdunk success for keaton who also teamed with ron howard in 1994s the paper he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included mr mom beetle juice and the dream team before venturing into batman one good cop and my life its also hard not to like gedde watanabes performance as the odd man out who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unitbr br the supporting cast is topnotch including wendt turturro shimono and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey hunts girlfriend edwin blum lowell ganz and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung hos solid writing the incidental music which received a bmi film music award was composed by thomas newman gung hos soundtrack songs are walltowall 80s including dont get me wrong tuff enuff and working class manbr br the success of gung ho actually led to a shortlived tv series on abc while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago ron howards film still has its comic value it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad shortchanged audio options are provided in english 51 surround english dolby surround and french dubbing but subtitles are in english only there are no extras not even the theatrical trailer on the plus side paramounts digital transfer is quite good with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound while a few extras would have been helpful  especially that gung ho was a box office success  theres little to complain about the film presentation itselfbr br  out of 4
