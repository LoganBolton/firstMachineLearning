this is a wonderful movie with a fun clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of whats important in life make this a very underappreciated movie dont let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy great movie all around
