surprised to see the rather low score for this movie just saw this film for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why i like itbr br come back with me children to a time when michael keaton was a straightup comedy guy and you might find some joy in this film its a gentle comedy  the kind ron howard specializes in  but if thats your thing you should check this out keatons lowkey charm is just right for this projectbr br gung ho is a bit dated because it takes places in the last stage of the preglobal economy world when it still mattered what country a business was based in that said it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other to great benefitbr br you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked but thats because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs its like an iv drip and i mean that in a good way
