sherman set the wayback machine for 1986 the united states was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession while japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the us economy and factory workers were a good example of the average american the word downsizing hadnt entered the general vocabulary yet but everyone knew the phenomenon bruce could be heard on the radio singing foreman says these jobs are going boy and they aint coming back to your hometown chrysler had just been bailed out by uncle sam bumper stickers could be seen saying buy american  the job you save may be your ownbr br gung ho does a better job of capturing the mood of the american industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period certainly the movie has its flaws  some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except michael keaton and gedde watanabe but the story really is about the meeting of east and west keatons hunt stevenson personifies america brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath watanabes kazuhiro personifies japan on top of the heap with a successful system but wondering if there is more to be learned from their western rivals the movies plot flawed as it is simply provides a framework for the conflict and eventually synthesis of their two personalitiesbr br keatons acting overshadows everyone elses and practically makes the movie by itself ive always admired keaton for his ability to deliver lines that feel improvised no matter what script hes following his character hunt stevenson is a likable affable everyman a natural leader with a wiseass streak but he has a fatal flaw common to many of us he doesnt want to disappoint anyone hell distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes and even lie rather than point out the ugly truthbr br kazuhiro is the mirror image of stevenson shy and introspective but also because of his japanese upbringing reluctant to be the bearer of bad news the scene in which stevenson first comes to kazuhiro with the employees grievances captures perfectly the japanese approach to workplace conflict kazuhiro replies to stevensons complaints with i understand what you are saying but wont refuse his requests out loud stevenson misinterprets this as agreement and goes away saying okay weve got that settled this is still a problem in japaneseamerican business relations in the 21st centurybr br ultimately kazuhiro and stevenson have the same problem get the factory working smoothly meet production goals and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them in working towards this goal they each have to take a page from the others book kazuhiros family becoming more americanized is an obvious example also note that stevenson thinks its odd when kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them  and yet later in the movie stevenson does exactly that himselfbr br the plot and its resolution are a little cornball but hey this is a comedy if you can overlook the movies flaws there is a great story about selfrealization and openmindedness here
