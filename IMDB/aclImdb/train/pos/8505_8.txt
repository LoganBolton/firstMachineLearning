many neglect that this isnt just a classic due to the fact that its the first 3d game or even the first shootemup its also one of the first stealth games one of the onlyand definitely the first truly claustrophobic games and just a pretty wellrounded gaming experience in general with graphics that are terribly dated today the game thrusts you into the role of bjdont even think im going to attempt spelling his last name an american pow caught in an underground bunker you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodesbut lets face it most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders the graphics are as i mentioned before quite dated and very simple the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators if you can get over that howeverand some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you then youve got one heck of a good shootersneaking game the game play consists of searching for keys health and ammo blasting enemiesaforementioned nazis and a boss enemy per chapter of varying difficultywhich of course grows as you move further in the game unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms there is a bonus count after each level is beaten it goes by how fast you werebasically if you beat the par time which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level this can be quite fun to try and beat and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in they are even challenging after many playthroughs how much nazi goldtreasure you collected and how many bad guys you killed basically if you got 100 of any of aforementioned you get a bonus helping you reach the coveted high score placings the game mostly but not always allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see you can either run or walk and amongst your weapons is also a knife running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard as is gunshots many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them nearly silently in your inventory you can get no less than four weapons and two keys more about the weapons later the keys unlock certain doors most doors in the game arent locked only two kinds need keys and these keys are only introduced in later levelsyou restart in levels resetting weaponry health score and lives in each chapter much of the later game is spent looking for them now as i just alluded to this game like many of the periodlate 80s early 90s is based on collecting extra lives personally i think its completely and utterly uselessit was mercifully dropped from here on end i think from the next 3d shooter and onwards since you can save anytime you want and using a life resets weaponry health and ammo like starting on a new chapterwhich is a real pain in later levels where you need heavier artillery now i shall beat around the bush no longer moving on to the guns you start with aforementioned knifewhich is silent but only effective up close and a pistol nothing special but good for conserving ammo unlike the next two bad boys your third weapon is a german smg a submachinegun its faster and automatic and some later enemies use it and the last one is nothing short of a gatling gun oh yeah think t2 think predator think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun its every bit as entertaining as it sounds most of the boss enemies use this though so be prepared i wont reveal the identities of these boss enemies however thats for each player to discover for himor herself the sound is excellent very crisp and realistic as you hear the tear of a machinegun firing the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german you truly feel like you are there trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems that segues me nicely into the level design as you run through seemingly countless nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood i almost got motion sickness more than oncethough that might also have something to do with little sleep lots of humidity and unusual warmth from playing though the level of detail isnt terribly high what there is is great remains of victims guards quarters and countless nazi symbols the list goes on the game also features quite a bit of gore for its limited graphics engine john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game what is there left to say the first of its kind and its no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters sure weapon bobbing and different height levelsstairs and such didnt come around until the next entry into the genre doom and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your viewso it goes beyond simply left and right adding vertical dimensions to it and jumping didnt come around until a third later titlethe first quake possibly fellow gamers help me out here but all of those games as well as the rest of the genre owe their existence to this one so load up the luger open the door to enter the bunker and step into bjs shoes he deserves the recognition evenor maybe even especially nearly fifteen years after he first appeared i recommended this to all fans of 3d games 810
