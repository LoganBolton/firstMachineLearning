  but it was on a uhf channel and the reception was very fuzzy id really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie i was driving that model bus it was only during his murder trial some 15 years later that i remember vaguely that oj was one of the stars in it i only recall that he was the driver and of the bus being shot up and driven wildly ive been looking all over for this movie to no avail since viewing it in the mid80s i liked the movie i dont usually watch thrillers but after reading the summary in the tv guide and viewing its beginning although fuzzy i stayed for the whole thing
