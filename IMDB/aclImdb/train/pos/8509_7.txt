i hate reading reviews that say something like dont waste your time this film stinks on ice it does to that reviewer yet for me it may have some sort of na√Øve charm if you like the other whistler series films this one will be watchable if you like 40s noirish films this one will be watchablebr br this film is not as good in my opinion as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard dix as the protagonist its much slower and the plot is trite youve seen this same narrative device used in many other films and usually betterbr br but the acting is good and so is the lighting and the dialog its just lacking in energy and youll likely figure out exactly whats going on and how its all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way throughbr br the whistler series is seminoir and there character mood lighting camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself but this film is not noir its too light weight and hollywood innocent for that neither richard dixs character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end you just never knew until the endbr br but still ill recommend this one for at least a single viewing ive watched it at least twice myself and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times
