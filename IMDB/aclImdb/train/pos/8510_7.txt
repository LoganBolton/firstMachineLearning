this was the eighth and final columbia whistler film and the only one without richard dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year its still a competent thriller the machine carried on without him perfectly but Â– something was missing dix the stories in the whistler series were always interesting sometimes brilliant the screenplays often noir always atmospheric but it wasnt only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen dix did toobr br young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad is the potential groom put off even when the private dick hes hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams or is love blind whos twisting who is the question michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp lovely lenore auberts finest moments came next film in abbott  costello meet frankenstein and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voicebr br a lot happened in this last hour well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me the whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what ive heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well
