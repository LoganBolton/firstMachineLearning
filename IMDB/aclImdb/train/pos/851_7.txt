pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns in an outrageous selfparody as the aging foulmouthed boozy assassin julian noble who has a particular fondness for teenage girls bullfights and tacky clothes during a job in mexico city he meets danny greg kinnear a straightfaced denver suburban businessman whos in town to make his deal ofalifetime in a hotel bar despite their completely different personalities and julians crude and insensible remarks they become friends br br largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear director richard shepard revealed that he didnt write the film with pierce brosnan in mind  but i can hardly imagine this without him he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or coldwar spies the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar stunning sets and beautifully photographed really is a bravura piece of acting skills the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully scripted the two actors are largely improvising but they succeed wonderfully it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clich√©s and the actors own typecasting brosnans james bond in particular and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood br br sadly the story wears thin after a while after an hour the film just runs out of steam nevertheless and i cant put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much it just feels very fresh and original with some imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to seijun suzuki and jeanpierre melville the other characters arent given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof very amusingbr br camera obscura  710
