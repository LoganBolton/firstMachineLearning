lupin sets off for morocco looking for a legendary treasure his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him its a nice different location for lupin with the desert and that hot exotic feelbr br one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual generally being in a different place than lupin on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed but it is a change of pace plus this way lupin can focus on the ladiesbr br fujiko rules in this throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin and us viewers then theres lara the damsel of this particular tale and shes quite likable this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime which is a fun distinction to havebr br theres a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy whos the best villain in this and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon as well as some fun scenes with fujiko inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here in fine formbr br pretty much this is a smooth ride with lupin the plot is average and there are some slow spots but all in all this movie is a real pleasure enjoy
