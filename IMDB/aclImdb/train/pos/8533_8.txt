this movie is more lupin then most especially coming from funimation other then the bad dub it isnt badbr br the first hour is a lot like the comic which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on lupins trying to get a huge treasure fujikos using lupins weakness to women to try to get something out of it the last bit isnt that bad hes with another women but of course fujikos still him number onebr br a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits they make it a little mushy but overall it isnt a bad film good enough to be one of the few id watch again of the lupin iii movies
