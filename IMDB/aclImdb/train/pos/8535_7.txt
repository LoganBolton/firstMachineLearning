this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs this film never tries to tone it down cotton candyize or soft soap the angst confusion and pain of what these guys live with that is its strength i thinkbr br but more so the performances are fantastic with well conceived and delivered dialog which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing whats on their mindwhats in their heartsbr br i found it plodding but enjoyablebr br it rates a 6610 frombr br the fiend
