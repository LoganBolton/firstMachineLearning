i recently got the chance to view the waterdance and quite liked it i dont really understand why its called that as there isnt really any dancing going on there except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie invalids in a hospital the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman which is a very sweet storyunfortunately you dont get to see movies like that today im not stuck in a time warp im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and theres much we can learn from old moviesby old movies i mean anything from 19201998
