i just watched the movie i was afraid its gonna disappoint me i was rather surprised at the end though the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times yes it wont be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies hadit is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did but what the hellit is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school beta house deserves 610 but i gave it 710 just for being another slice of pie
