 firstly although many say it is the worst of the series i dont think that it is trueconsidering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters dobr br  i agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays arent supposed to be for teenagersi mean cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out plus seeing such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for having a very good timebr br  many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie welllets get realdoesnt that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie what would you like to seesmart booksromantic stuff that is not at all what would be in those teenagers minds br br  to conclude i think that if you are a teenager you must absolutely see the movie and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenageror things like that thanks for reading
