i have to hand it to the creative team behind these american pie movies direct to dvd typically is synonymous with cheap incompetent filmmaking yet last year i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself thoroughly enjoying the dvd sequel the naked mile the filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy yet funny little film this year they offer up the followup beta house this is the honest truth beta house makes the first few american pie movies look like the little mermaidbr br this is no holds barred tasteless laughout loud fun sure the story is a bit thin but thats the beauty of the whole thing within the first 10 minutes were introduced to the all the main characters the new supporting characters get a handful of raunchy gags meet the villains and establish the general plotline with all that out of the way the movie becomes a nolimits ride the gags are a plenty and they did not hold back in this one im talking male semen urine dildos chickswithdicks sex with sheep female orgazim sprays and plenty more not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scenebr br returning from the naked mile are john white jake siegel steve talley and eugene levy in a similar supporting role as the last few films the entire cast does fine work steve talley dwight stifler in particular has a great energy and screen presence i predict good things for him the film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open by far the biggest laugh of the film for me was the deerhunter parody classicbr br the bottom line is if youre a fan of the series youll feel right at home with beta house it really pushes the limits of good taste but in the end is pretty damn funny
