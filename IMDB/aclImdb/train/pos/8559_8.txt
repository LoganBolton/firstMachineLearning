there is a certain genius behind this movie i was laughing throughout the scene in the phone sex office discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this geniushumor execution is poor but you can see the writers message and they do have some talent the doppelganger split at the end was like ok wasnt quite expecting that but lets see what the movie has to say certainly ridiculous but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange waybr br is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level im easily bored by many movies but this one kept my interest throughoutbr br i think the story may have some autobiographical roots but thats just a guess horribly bad but good im looking for other movies this person may have done with more experience
