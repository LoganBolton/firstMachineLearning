this film is fantastic finally wellwritten characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flatout hysterical in this selfeffacing role i think its the best thing hes ever done hes done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fullyfledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
