i liked it the plot was weird drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool and as always he does his best  im a major dennis fan anyway thats why i bought the dvdbr br i didnt get the ending that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool which is ok i guess but it could have been more br br and the whole thing with the knife if it was that uncomfortable why didnt they just get rid of it br br it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dcor was it dennis all the time because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would noticebr br the music was ok but obtrusive in places the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdonebr br a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude br br all in all a bit of a gpmguilty pleasure movie dont read too much into it dont look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it there are some diamond moments and goofs galore watch it and just have a bit of fun with it
