i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time dont take the film all too seriously because remember its disney and its rated g its good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice particularly the triangle between cruella le pelt and cruellas faithful valet alonso glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is cured of her fur loving ways she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her bipolarity as the dog loving ella all in all i will go see it again in theaters i found myself enjoying it so much
