the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission he plays a kind of james bonds psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt as an intense hitman his character is very sexual but even better very funny add the kindhearted uberlikable american guy next door greg kinnear to set up contrast the myriad locations vivid colors and quickwitted humor provide great entertainment hope davis is well cast as the gem of a wife but the focus of the film is on the two fellows a new odd couple and thats the part that works very well have a great probably rrated laugh and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper
