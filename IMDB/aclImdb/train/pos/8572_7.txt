the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumesespecially cruellas and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruellas accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously overthetop performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice 710 bethany cox
