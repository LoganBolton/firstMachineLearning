enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adultsbr br glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella call me ella de villebr br after three years in dr pavlovs behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppyskin fur she had so intensely desired she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabitsbr br but it wouldnt be a dalmatian movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification and now she needs one extra puppy hence 102 dalmatians to complete her nefarious scheme this time roundbr br ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the second chance dog shelter though he was in titanic and in last years television version as pip of great expectations i didnt recognize him well he was fifth officer lowe in titanic and i didnt see great expectations so i am not terribly surprisedbr br gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrierpawn of cruella he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well his wicked witch of the west homage is hilariousbr br tim mcinnerny is superb is cruellas notsoevil henchman  he was also alonzo cruellas butler in 101 dalmatians and you may also recognize him from all of the black adder britcoms he plays his usual bumbling goodhearted somewhat dimwitted character to great effectbr br oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic and worthy of such an overthetop character her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nominationbr br animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans it cant be done suffice it to say that 102 dalmatians is even better than the film version of 101 dalmatians that came out in 1996 there is a lot to like here from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting  it is a good film for the whole family
