this film is one of the finest american bmovies of the 90s if youre looking for a serious film look elsewhere however if youre looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching everyone chews the scenery a bit but thats really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together
