greetings again from the darkness much anticipated twisted comedy from writerdirector richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor that bond guy is gone this new guy is something else entirely have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble facilitator  and is anything but pretty do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a sombrero is a joy to beholdbr br greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnans comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnears wife whats with her name bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living roombr br the visuals and settings are perfect  including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky filmmaking it could be for you
