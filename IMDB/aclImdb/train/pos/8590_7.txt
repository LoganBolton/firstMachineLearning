seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend 15 on this i also think this applies to eva longoria fansbr br the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president as the investigation unfolds it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete michael douglas pleading innocence pete goes on the fun fugitive style to search for the truthbr br its solid but certainly not spectacular a decent cast a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty but you could certainly do far worse
