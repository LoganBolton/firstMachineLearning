the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was righta great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasnt and it was a very smart story michael douglas in this film is very good and keither sutherland is toobut however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24also another person trying to shrug off their tv role but failedeva longeriashe wasnt that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thingafter i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldnt sleepoverall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it
