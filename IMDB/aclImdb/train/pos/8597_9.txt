i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something thats never happened before  a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael douglas character pete garrison they think hes the mole but he isnt br br hes just a morallyflawed agent having an affair with the first lady since hes doing that hes unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when its revealed there is a plot to kill the presidentbr br garrison is forced to go on the lam but at the same time hes still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president douglas does a fine job in this role i dont always care the people he plays but hes an excellent actor keifer sutherland david breckinridge is equally as good at least in here as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop if they can the plot the crooks are interesting too by the way also i have never  and never will unfortunately  see a first lady who looks as good as kim basingerbr br this is simply a slick action flick that entertains starttofinish are there holes in it of course probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments however it is unfairly bashed here it just isnt intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website my advice chill just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue yes it gets a little ramboish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainmentwhich is what movies are all about
