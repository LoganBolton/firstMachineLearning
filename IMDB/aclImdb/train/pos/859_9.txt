its so rare to find a film that provides a plot that cant be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting throughoutbr br a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausebr br the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might bebr br the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
