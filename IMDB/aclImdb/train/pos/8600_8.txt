there was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer for starters the casting didnt seem right kiefer sutherland had already done very well in 24 and the preview didnt seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience eva longoria appeared out of place and the rest didnt seem very interestingbr br when the film finally ended i was not completely displeased for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development we have seen threats of this type before and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers as an audience we dont want to sit through the same old story again we want to see something different be thrilled and entertainedbr br there is nothing wrong with the casting from kim basingers delicious first lady she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable michael douglas has been and done that before unfortunately the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate sutherland rehashes his 24 tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen and eva does a passable job as the newcomerbr br dont expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics north by northwest and the fugitive come to mind leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be its ok
