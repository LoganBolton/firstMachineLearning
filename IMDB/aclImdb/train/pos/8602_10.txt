one used to say concerning nathaniel hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonaldeddys pictures and especially this one br br it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie its kitsch the script because of censorship sounds inconsistentÂ… yet this movie gets also some good points good rodgersharts music i married an angel tira tira tira la good acting with eehorton and reginald owen br br anyway if you may dislike it you cant forget it this strange movie actually leaves a very strong dreamlike impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks why in the thirties and the beginning of the forties movies didnt have the same mean than today it aimed like a dream to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality of all the the dreammovies that was made in that time this one stands as particularly powerfulbr br in short lets say that the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering whether its good or bad to watch it like you would watch a dream
