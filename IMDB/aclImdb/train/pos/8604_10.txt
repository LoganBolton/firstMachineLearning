i know a lot of people dont like this movie but i just think it is adorable theres not much i can say but the movie is a feelgood movie i guess the songs are beautiful the costumes are beautiful the voices are beautiful and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie especially as briggitta learns about the dos and donts of society if you like musicals id say youd like this one
