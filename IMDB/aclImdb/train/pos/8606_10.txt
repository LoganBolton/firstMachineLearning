it appears that theres no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams its often foolish and illogical its also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angelbr br jeanettes deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach br br its a surreal comedytremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
