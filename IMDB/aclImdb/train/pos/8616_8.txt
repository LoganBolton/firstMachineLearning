what if a platoon of gis from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate great pitch right the movie does exactly what it says on the tinbr br thankfully the writers didnt bother to explain the usually ridiculous in scifi movies scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport no hows or whys they just did however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful if not a bit dated not as silly as one would imaginebr br the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the gis arrival to medieval japan it picks up with a devastating battle sequence undoubtedly its the main order of the day the whole concept and by extension the movie itself was probably originated from this simple pitch what if gis equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais and boy does it deliverbr br the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70s actionwar movies not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length its also a terrific mishmash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like gi samurai can deliver i mean where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ninjas complete with shuriikens a helicopter and samurais in the same shot the gi platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras gunning them down with machine guns mortars grenades and tanksbr br this mishmash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidaigeki epic of kurosawas kagemusha or hiroshi inagakis samurai banners while the other is in western action and war movies there are stylistic touches like the wonderful slowmotion shots and bloody violence that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g castellari circa keoma to mind japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa and gi samurai effortlessly turns this eastmeetswest melting pot into an exciting filmbr br the filmmakers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it not that tongueincheek mentality is completely absent its just that it doesnt try to pander to sobaditsgood audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies the budget was probably hefty as it is evident in the hundreds of extras elaborate costumes very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidaigeki and special effects the camerawork and editing are all top notch almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deservesbr br its not withouts its flaws either of course there are many song scenes where all sorts of 70s japanese rock disco and country songs play over montages theres a bonding scene a loveinterest scene a war is hell scene etc the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes it flies like a bullet for the most part still some scenes flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effectbr br the cast also deserves a mention featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba isao natsuyagi goyokin samurai wolf tsunehiko watase the yakuza papers and hiroyuki sanada all of them hitting the right notes
