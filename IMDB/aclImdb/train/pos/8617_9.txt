gi samurai sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason and much carnage ensues its a rather over the top essay of sword vs machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting resultsbr br the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title initial fishoutthewater antics what is this flying metal box etc etc arent we better off here discussions and ultimately a huge battle the latter is proof that the film doesnt take itself seriously at all the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chibas platoon a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance its certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesnt drag despite its extended lengthbr br chiba gives a gruff performance as iba initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers as they seem to be asking werent we better off back then but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of almost non stop action
