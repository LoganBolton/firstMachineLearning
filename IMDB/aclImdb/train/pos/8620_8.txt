i just finished watching the 139 min version widescreen with some friends and we were blown away i wont bother repeating what others have said what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun the huge battle is exhausting afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didnt keep us from being completely involved and entertainedbr br there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific musicsongs blues countryfolk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter its hideous you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you groundedbr br there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera there are many uses of silence as well as slowmotion photography that work beautifully i really wish i could erase the music but alasbr br seek this out its fun its different and it takes you to places you wouldnt expect and thats very refreshing
