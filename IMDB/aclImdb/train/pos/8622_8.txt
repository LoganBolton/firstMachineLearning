i just cant agree with the above comment  theres lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for its effective use of silence whats more it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way not pulling any punches in what it shows yet not dwelling and oversensationalising the subject matter it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and arthouse cinema and deserves a place amongst the canon of different horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on its definitely worth seeing if youre interested in the edges of horror cinema
