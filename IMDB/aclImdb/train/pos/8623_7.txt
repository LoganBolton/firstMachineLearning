der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film  but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and its reasons and ramifications those looking for a gorefest or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed der todesking is definitely an arthouse style film so those that need linear explainable narratives need not applybr br the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an episode for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpsebr br there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes including the man talking about the problems with his wife and the concert massacre which unfortunately lost some of its power on me because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions lookalike band on stage but seriously  this is a sometimes beautiful the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective  especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge sometimes confusing sometimes silly the she wolf of the ss ripoff is pretty amusing sometimes harrowing i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective film that is more of an experience then just entertainment as many of these art films are meant to be still i didnt find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in terms of my personally enjoyment level definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or art film fan if you dig this type of film  check out subconscious cruelty  in my opinion the best arthousehorror film that ive seen 710 for der todesking
