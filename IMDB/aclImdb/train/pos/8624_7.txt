whats the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking let me start by saying ive just come direct from viewing this movie and the images are still burned deep into my brain  and i dont think theyll be moving any time soonbr br its probably fair to say that if youre on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you havent seen it if not let me forewarn you that this is not a moderatebudget gem thats been lost for a few years a la near dark nor is it a low budget schlocky fun bmovie what it is it lowbudget art put forward in a simple yet poignant way the idea is a simple one  seven stories revolving around and ending in suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse sounds simple right even boring it isnt words cant really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or notbr br i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky i could point out that some of the sound effects are outofsync in a way to rival any fulci movie but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificancebr br as far as extreme movies go ive seen the hardest of them and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider gratuitous in fact the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale i wont ruin it just to say that the characters emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise if not yearn for his end br br sure its not the best movie ever made and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema if youre someone who likes comfortable viewing or nice movies or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless this is not what youre looking for br br whether you enjoy it or not its one you wont forget in a hurry
