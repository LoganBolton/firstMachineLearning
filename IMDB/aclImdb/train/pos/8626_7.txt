der todesking is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry jörg buttgereits second cult monument in a row which is actually a lot better than the infamous nekromantik exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated peoples suicides in between these already very disturbing episodes buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse the episodes arent all equally powerful but as a wholesome der todesking is ranked quite high on the list of alltime most depressing arthouse films particularly the episodes on wednesday involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park and the one of sunday focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead are extremely intense and devastating to observe the added value of this film or any other shockumenary like it is debatable and im not even sure whether or not buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here theres the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these peoples motivations to end their lives so dramatically entirely unlike i expected der todesking isnt exploitative or repulsively graphic on the contrary actually i never could have hoped buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery the thursday episode is a perfect example of this as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous german bridge while the names ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen the production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism but this isnt what really counts in this type of cinema the subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life great use of tragic music too
