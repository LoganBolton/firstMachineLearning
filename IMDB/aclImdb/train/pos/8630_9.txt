the author of nekromantik jörg buttgereits second feature film der todesking is a powerful masterpiece centered around a chain letter originating from a group called the brotherhood of the 7th day the movie shows 7 episodes each consisting of one day during one week where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making its rounds do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals enjoy happy or even remotely normal movies or expect a movie to be good only if it is focused on stage actingbr br the nihilistic avantgarde approach of der todesking well explains why buttgereits movies in general were banned in germany their native country of origin during the 80s and most of the 90s der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing onscreen but the meaningless apathy or depression most peoples lives consist of in general buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living only reasons to stop and in choosing how and when you die you can also be the king of death der todeskingbr br buttgereits movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies art film would probably be the closest description every time der todesking features an original method to shoot create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene during one scene the camera slowly continuously pans in 360 degree circle while a person lives in a small oneroom apartment for a day during another buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man while he dwells in his desperation during a third seemingly pleasant scene names ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown onscreen supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular moviebr br episode movies and especially this one as the scenes are only vaguely connected generally suffer from incoherence and der todesking is no exception while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and its consequences or subsequences in all its variations there are very powerful episodes yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material partly draining the overall power of the movie  still the the jawdropping immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from its more vague moments back to the status of greatness the general atmosphere is baffling aweinspiring highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting  so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part ofbr br this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans this is a small different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience whether it be confusion amazement or even hate you arent likely to be left cold by this in my opinion the best achievement of this small indie crewbr br the main theme of the movie die fahrt ins reich der menschentrümmer part iiii was released in a limited 666piece 8 vinyl edition which is now much sought after you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting the nekromantik soundtrack cd which i highly recommend the lofi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky almost illbientlike makes an essential part of the movies atmosphere and is something you would very very rarely hear otherwise much recommended
