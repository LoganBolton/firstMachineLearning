love at the topthe utterly wrongheaded american title for the superb french film le mouton enrage which means i think the rabid sheep is such an original movie the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding this film was far ahead of its time even by todays highest standards it accomplishes things that seem rich and new filmed by the hugely underrated director michel deville it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique comedy mystery love sex and satire into one wholly original mixleaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable the cast is splendid ditto the writing and theme but its devilles delicious tone keeping you constantly offbalance but enrapt that pushes this lost film to a very high level indeed the written interview with the director on the special features section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time
