david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california but cant really afford to so they ride share with another young couple brad pitt and juliette lewis to save on expenses the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way sites where serial killers did their thing since brian duchovny is a writer and carrie forbes is his photographer what they dont know is that pitt earley and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says i dont care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles the scary thing is that he does them so well ive actually known people like him before no not killers but with pretty much the same mindset anyway as the road trip goes along carrie guesses that the others are about out of money but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehownever mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though lewis does her role well one that she excels at a nottoobright waif that has a good heart but doesnt understand that she doesnt have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesnt like as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station and unfortunately its at that point where shes inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who theyve been ridesharing with after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip this is not the greatest flick in the world but its not badi watched what was supposed to be the unrated version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version because this seemed fairly tame to me reallynot that this makes it family fare or anything unless its maybe the manson family 7 out of 10
