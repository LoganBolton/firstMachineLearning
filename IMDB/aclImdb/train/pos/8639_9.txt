i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 7580 of this film was hilarious its mostly because of brad pitts performance spot onbr br the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all respects im not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles everbr br brutalhonestgritty all good words to describe this moviebr br i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind earlys violence isnt explained it is explained but they thankfully dont have to go into graphic detail to get their point acrossbr br overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie underrated
