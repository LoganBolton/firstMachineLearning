  a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgottenbr br 12  a classic in time simply a must seebr br   a solid worthwhile very entertaining piecebr br 12  a good movie but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flawsbr br   may still be considered good in areas but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable eg genrebr br 12  mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsbr br bomb  not of a viewable qualitybr br  kalifornia  br br  unrated for strong violent material considerable sexuality and languagebr br i rented this film expecting an inyourface summerblockbusterquality celebration of brad pitts face but was happily surprised and disappointed this really is more of a drama and very grim at that i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voiceoversbr br pitt plays out his possibly unsexiest film ever with startling talent who started out as a hopeless yet harmless white trash husband became realized as a violent disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind during some of the latter stages in the film i found it hard to keep watching him  he was unpredictable and scary this proves very good writing and actingbr br the whole movie is filled with bizarre sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once and i dont mean action scenes i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death again i am very impressed with the screenwriters whoever they are did the impossible mixed oil and waterbr br i also very much enjoyed juliette lewiss performance it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy some of her moments in this film brought me to tears i mean that the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible and i clearly remember getting blurryeyed on a few occasionsbr br i almost feel like im cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving kalifornia a  rating but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it i do believe that everyone should see this movie though i truly do
