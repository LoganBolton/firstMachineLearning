i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me alas i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by kalifornia upon watching again recently i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years agobr br there are two things which really give this movie its power the first is its cast we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace knowing pitt as we all do as one of the most enduring heartthrobs hollywood has ever had it is refreshing to see him play such a vile unattractive character pitt pulls the show off without resorting to whitetrash clich√© or parody and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the moviebr br juliette lewis is equally impressive as graces tragic girlfriend playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year olds life experience lewis manages to evoke pity for her characters station in life as well as contempt for her naivety but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young personally i think its a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances herebr br david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis duchovony is aptly geeky and naive and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shutoff but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters changes as they are equally intrigued repulsed and strangely attracted to pittbr br the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing at the time kalifornia was released hollywood was releasing a slew of nicecharacterturnsouttobepsychotic movies single white female pacific heights the hand that rocks the cradle deceived sleeping with the enemy etc most of these movies followed the same formula the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy kalifornia doesnt really stray too far from this territory but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slowboil thriller and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turnbr br when the penny does drop and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes dont quite live up to rest of the movie that said the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold the fight is over but the scars will always be therebr br much of the narration provided by a somewhat whiny pre xfiles duchovony is a tad contrived of course its meant to be from the book the duchovonys journalist character has written so one could argue that the selfconscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists writebr br the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90 of the thrillers of the past twenty years highly recommended but not for the weak of stomach or mind this film is disturbing on more than one level but then its meant to be
