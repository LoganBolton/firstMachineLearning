in 1990 brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen filmbr br kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovnys obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers in fact hes got a most unusual odyssey planned he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers but he and forbes are flat brokebr br fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amoralitybr br kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life lewiss dialog and forbess reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the countrybr br for those who like their slasher flicks they dont come better than kalifornia
