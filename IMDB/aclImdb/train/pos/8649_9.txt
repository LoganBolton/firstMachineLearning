i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night i do like juliette lewis although im indifferent to brad pitt after this viewing i have to admit hes a perfectly fine actor  his character was entirely believable and i didnt think brad pitt at allbr br unfortunately i cant say the same for david duchovny im an xfiles fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as id thought it was made a few years later i like duchovny but found his character a little twodimensional here except where hes doing voiceovers that part was strong seemed in character good intonation etc otherwise i kept thinking agent mulder which is a pitybr br michelle forbes was a treat why havent i noticed her before ill be looking up to see what other roles shes done and seeing those asap i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis this film and natural born killers a firm favourite interesting though to see a contrast of characters  in nbk shes a willing accomplice whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge earlys dark side until its thrust in her facebr br i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly apart from duchovnys character not seeming fullyformed and perhaps being washed out somewhat by pitts it was perfect i was also pleased with the ending  glad that the innocent heroes did not die yet they had to suffer first it was realistic tense disturbingbr br if you like nbk you may well like this movie and viceversa
