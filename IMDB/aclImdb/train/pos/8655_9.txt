kalifornia is one of my alltime favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s the film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others one of the films strongest aspects is its performances brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailertrash psycho named early pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heartbreaking kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality there are alot of shocking scenes and it all mounts to a powerhouse climax that will haunt you for days kalifonia is a film that should really be watched for its intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for its violence and gore
