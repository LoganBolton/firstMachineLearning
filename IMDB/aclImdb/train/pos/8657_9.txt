its amazing that so many people that i know havent seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great moviebr br ive never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on targetbr br everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movies slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happeningbr br the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but thats the only flaw i could find in this cult classicbr br if you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated directors cut for the best viewing optionbr br rating9
