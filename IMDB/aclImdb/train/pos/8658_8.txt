its a road movie with a killer onboard brian kessler david duchovny a sophisticated urbane writer wants to conduct field research on american serial killers but neither he nor his girlfriend carrie michelle forbes has the money for a crosscountry tour of murder sites so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses who they end up with is a young couple early grayce brad pitt and his girlfriend adele juliette lewis two better examples of poor white trash you will never find in all of cinemabr br indeed early and adele are what make this film so entertaining as they babble cackle confide muse speculate drool and otherwise behave in ways i havent seen since reruns of the beverly hillbillies earlys idea of california people think faster out there on account of all that warm weather cold weather makes people stupid thats enough to convince adele i guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here to which early responds proudly it sure does early continues to instruct adele about california you never have to buy no fruit on account its all on the trees  and they aint got no speed limits and i hear your first months rent is free state lawbr br but poor early has some well mental problems which become ever more obvious to brian and carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the us as they enter the desert southwest with its beautifully stark landscape kalifornia starts to look more and more like the hitcher 1986 and early starts to act more and more like john ryder everyones maniacal hitchhiker whose terror seemed so unstoppablebr br in kalifornia the acting is uneven duchovnys performance is flat brad pitt is surprisingly effective despite his overacting at times michelle forbes is great as the avantgarde photographic artist but my choice for best performance goes to juliette lewis with her nasal voice and heavyduty southern accent she is stunning as the naive highly animated childlike adelebr br toward the end the film takes on a twilight zone feel to it as our travelers enter a nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins the plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence an ending that was somewhat disappointingbr br overall however kalifornia is an entertaining film thanks to a clever concept great scenery especially in the second half good cinematography great dialogue and that wonderful performance by juliette lewis
