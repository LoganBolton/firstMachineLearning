in a way this film reminded me of jumping jack flash remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine whoopi zonked out tranquilizers whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right thats how i feel about rich in love a man hears his wife sing for the first time postcoital teenagers talk about the nature of love albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe but theres only the whisper of a plot here and you cant wait for it to get moving only when exgogos charlotte caffeys the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake upand then its overbr br this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summers day in the deep american south
