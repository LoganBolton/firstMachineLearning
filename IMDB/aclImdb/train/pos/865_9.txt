vincent cassel plays the part of paul an excon assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not played by emmanuelle devos together they help each other to develop as peoplebr br what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that hes just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shinesbr br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justifiedbr br finally it is a film full of great moments both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort
