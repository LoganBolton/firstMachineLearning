this is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe  dad they have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something second time through you realize how horribly the sisters husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar he takes it its the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather in that same scene the sisters blues song is a real tearjerker if youre the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music her performance feels like the climax of the story a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods sc meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies thats cool long as you recognize it as fiction
