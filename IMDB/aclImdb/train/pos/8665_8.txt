i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol 1 collection of pure eurotrash movies but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there stupednous it is not satisfying it is watching this movie i couldnt help to wonder how come sergio martino didnt make this flick this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii doublecrosses and triplecrosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through besides lees more recognizable films filmgoers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone wouldve lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time and 14 of the budget this is what it wouldve turned out to be like so refreshing it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matin√©e
