frankie dio lee vancleef is a highranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling for reasons that seem unclear to me tony tony lo bianco is a lowlevel thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying frankie by being in the right place at the right time tony gets arrested with frankie and is sent to jail where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship but it will do for nowbr br this film came to me under the title of frank and tony which is disappointing because i see an alternate name is mean frank and crazy tony which would have helped sell the film more effectively i presume thats an homage to dirty mary crazy larry but what do i know i watched it shortly after another italian crime film violent professionals and i must say the two complement each other very wellbr br italians have always lagged behind americans in their budgets and production values which is a real shame with this film it is considered a grindhouse film which unfairly demotes it to a bmovie or worse with a cleaner sound and picture this could have been a hollywood hit i suspect i found the story very interesting the characters and actors better than average and unlike violent professionals the plot is fairly clear  not too many secondary charactersbr br if you like mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try a film about the mob thats actually from italy how much more authentic do you want is as much as you can ask sure its not the godfather but its not supposed to be this isnt a drama its a light comedy heavy action buddy film like die hard with a vengeance from the point of view of the bad guys well okay not reallybr br if nothing else this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast films besides escape from new york where vancleef plays hauk and the usual cult movies whats more fun than discovering a lost classic
