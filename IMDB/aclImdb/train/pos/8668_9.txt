i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo and his was easily the standout the films three stories it wasnt my favorite of the shorts but it was the most unique and the most iconic the lovers on the bridge was the first of his full length features ive seen a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic though hes classified as a neonouvelle vogue his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60s experimental narratives his movies are closer to jean vigo in latlante jean cocteau and guy maddin than godard and truffautbr br in boy meets girl caraxs 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible emotional and engaging like vigos moviesbr br the story of boy meets girl is simple and similar to caraxs two following films which comprise this young lovers trilogy a boy named alex played by denis lavant who plays a character named alex in caraxs next two movies has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate he steals records for her and leaves them at his friends apartment but avoids contacting either of them directly he wanders around and finds his way to a party where he meets a suicidal young woman and the film becomes part breathless and part limelightbr br later he is advised by an old man with sign language to speak up for yourselfyoung people today its like they forgot how to talk the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film and how an actor timid off stage became a confident lion when in front of the camera heres where the movie tips its hand but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene since it overlaps the style of the film silent and expressionist with the content a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which arent easy to nail down from moment to moment aside from a desire to fall in lovebr br there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies all crying in a chorus that fills that room until he turns on a tape of a childrens show making them fall silent unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses even as carax is selfreflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell the room full of whining infants hes mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses even the rich old bell of the ball has a brother she misses in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silencebr br though indebted to films before talkies carax is a master of music knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedys holiday in cambodia or an early david bowie song the sounds of a man playing piano or of a girl softly hummingbr br in boy meets girl when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel when alex enters a party an feels out of place its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance like the famous author who cant speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet michel gondry and wes anderson whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy all have a parallel with different visuals musical and emotional cues in these carax moviesbr br every line of dialog every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level some i lack words to articulate there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment the other movies you want to watch can wait see this first if i were to make films i would want them to be like this in fact i wish all films were like this where the ephemeral becomes larger than life and life itself becomes a dream
