if unlike some of the commenters here you are not staging a class war and dont mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful extroverted bohemian gasp and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making id defend this the film isnt any worse as a result and it puts the spotlight on the cast some of whom are really good kate hardie think thats her name as the sarcastic drunk is spoton the one exception being david baddiel who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff its light and we dont go for this kind of anatomisingofrelationship crap in this country but if you dont have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this
