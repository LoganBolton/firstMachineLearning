wwe armageddon december 17 2006  live from richmond coliseum richmond va br br kane vs mvp in an inferno match so this is the fourth ever inferno match in the wwe and it is kane vs mvp wonder why was it the first match on the card i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets mvps ass on fire as theyre on the apron and then mvp is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as mvp sprawls around the entrance ramp funny and visually quite entertaining ending 710br br wwe tag team championship this was originally supposed to be william regal  dave taylor vs brian kendrick  paul london c in a regular tag team match however gm teddy long comes to the ring and announces that its going to be a fatal 4way tag team ladder match mnm and the hardys are thrown in and its all chaos one word to describe this eyeopener  wow man i really cant remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words cant really do it justice there was one particularly notable spot where the hardys set up a ladder in a seesaw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held mnm for the kill and then wham nitro blew away while mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face he had to be taken away and nitro continued the match alone another spot was when jeff powerbombed london while flipping off the ladder there were other highflying breathtaking spots too many to remember london finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave showstealer 8510br br the boogeyman vs the miz the two men get thrown in and around the ring until boogeyman explodes a sitout powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over the mizs mouth as usual 5510 for this threeminute incognitobr br united states championship chris benoit c faces off chavo guerrero in yet another typical guerrero match some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by chavo and an unusually long chain of german suplexes by benoit vicki guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a sharpshooter or not this allows chavo to go for a rollup but benoit rolls it up once more and chavo is locked in the sharpshooter game over nice hardfought battle albeit slow at times 710br br wwe cruiserweight championship gregory helms c vs jimmy wang yang for this one in a fairly moderatepaced match the match had some good highflying spots  most notably helms moves off the top rope  but the crowd didnt seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match and yang needs to get more airborne helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee 7510br br the undertaker vs mr kennedy in a last ride match after a series of matches between these two this time it is a last ride match the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse pretty good indeed for what these two could offer kennedy manhandled a good deal of taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw taker off the armageddon set about 15 feet below and thank god for kennedy otherwise it wouldve been brutal kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the hearse i liked the camera view inside the hearse taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on kennedy and broke the hearses window instead but then later busted kennedy open with a chair and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and tombstone on the hearses roof kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the arena to win i actually found myself really interested into these guys willingness to takegive real sick shots 7510br br santa comes into the ring i go what the hell like many of the kids in the crowd and then the word lingerie contest gets in my ear break timebr br batista  john cena vs finlay  king booker talk about charisma vs technicality this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense even finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time i kind of doubted his strength against the champs and him and booker mainly didnt succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where booker rammed his scepter into cenas throat batista hits the bomb on booker for the win didnt get to see the fu cena performed the 5 knuckle shuffle anyhow and i think he also did the stfu this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7510br br being an onandoff wwe fan i have to agree that armageddon was laced up with numerous eyecatchers throughout and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show the last ride match featured some fairly nervewrenching spots and the main event also did very well for its category all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs the miz bout and the everuseless lingerie contest overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable payperview and despite some big setbacks earlier in the ppv chronology armageddon wishes this years goodbye respectably ppv rating 810
