without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutesbr br it all starts with a big fight between tom jerry and spike who is renamed butch here theyre all beating each other but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends which isnt going to last for longbr br meanwhile the three become affectionate patient and kind to each other they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalriesbr br but still to see tom jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a whilebr br oh by the way as a curious fact two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in instrumental versions were off to see the wizard and somewhere over the rainbow
