if you are a fan then you will probably enjoy this if you dont know who misty mundae darian caine ruby larocca or seduction cinema are this is not the movie to start out with its very cute silly the girls are hot and its fun to watch theres no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film but the score is cheesytrippy and the plots not a total bore misty mundaes makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids so shes not as hot in this as she has been in others but her panties in this are quite cute youll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird if you do like this one you will probably enjoy that 70s girl vampire vixens or erotic survivor which is a bit more sexually graphic if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual more horrorexploitationbased but lower budget movies check out the factory 2000 website
