as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical malefemale relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the malebr br for those of us that dont speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonablebr br the soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the films variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies theres a wes craven in chicago feel to it
