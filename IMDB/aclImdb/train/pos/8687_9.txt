this was the second entry in the regular columbo series and it holds up well today as i am able to look at it closely now on dvd and see how it is constructed i am very impressed with the direction of bernard l kowalski who directed the fine macho callahan as well as countless tv episodeswatch how the postmurder actions of the killer are shown on a splitscreen effect on his two eyeglasses watch how the murder itself is shown in montage fashion watch the pointofview shot from the perspective of the corpse also the wild but impressive avantgarde musical score from noted jazzman gil melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere and the supporting performance of brett halsey as the golf pro was wonderfulsuch subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a onedimensional cutout the formula had not yet been set when this episode was filmed so there are still some surprises in columbos methods of course falk robert culp and ray milland are the highestquality actors and its a pleasure to see them workall men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here in all this entry in the columbo seriesand many of the othersare as wellcrafted as a very good feature film
