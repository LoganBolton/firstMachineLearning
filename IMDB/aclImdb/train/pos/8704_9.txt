there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood latelybr br a friend sends me movies now and again as a surprise its awesomebr br i turned it on and couldnt stop watching it is a drama but with a odd twist imagine if romeo as in shakepeare had a super power it is sad and poetic at the same time hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist granted its not perfect but nothing ever is you know what the power is but it is never explained nor totally realized until the end it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story i dont want to see a remake it is too cool as is the hollywood system would as usual mess it up acting is top notch all around directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there kudos to all involvedand i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic abr br if you can find i watch it
