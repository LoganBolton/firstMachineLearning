despite the title the sword bearer and the dvd cover actionherioc poses of the sword bearer this is not a super hero filmbr br minor spoilers it follows the tale of sasha the sword bearer who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm cool you say but no this is real life if you had this power as a child could you control it when say faced by a mad man or when your mums boyfriend is beating her and if you dont control it how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12br br this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him wandering aimlessly after another killing much like a bout de souffl√© he then meet katya and the pair fall instantly in love providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officersbr br that is essentially the story and there is virtually no action on screen though a lot if suggestedbr br i really like this movie unlike many hollywood super hero films we get very little back story there is no bad guy unless you count the sword bearer himself abut there is a lot of heart and good character developmentbr br worth checking out if you can find it
