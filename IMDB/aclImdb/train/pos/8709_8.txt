i recently may 2008 discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd although ive seen a great deal of high quality movies since then late 70s i was 10 in 1978 this threeepisode low budget thing still stands strongbr br whats fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then the creepy music she had to hold my hand even though shes been raised with watching lotr and resident evil the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie actingbr br this is the one and only good science fiction movie or series ever made in norway and its still worth watching
