read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slopebr br the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who ive never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy andor threatening look and voice to some us moviesbr br the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and hes the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an excon and her wrenching adaptation to that milieubr br writerdirector jacques audiard very cleverly uses the womans isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so its even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as wellbr br none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stakeouts br br there is a side story thats thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breathsbr br this is one of my favorites of the year br br originally written 7282002
