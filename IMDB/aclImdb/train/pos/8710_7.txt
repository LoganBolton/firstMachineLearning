i remember this show from swedish television i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond beliefbr br i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changedbr br although this was released before alien and a plethora of other spacethrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50s and the political climate of the 70s when i think of it this was a real scifi a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are the term scifi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has spaceships in them
