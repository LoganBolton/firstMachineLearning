its beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from norway has been remastered for dvd release and still gems like this dont get a shot at recapturing their past glory i give this a 7 not because it is very good but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television this film is nothing less than a filmhistoric gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first alien film and my word blindpassasjer was first did ridley scott or anyone in the crew see the miniseries however unlikely the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar okay the budget is much lower in the norwegian film but given that its a really welldone piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian moviemaking which incidentally lasted until the 90s
