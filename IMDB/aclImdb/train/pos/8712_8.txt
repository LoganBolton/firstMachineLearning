ok i admit im one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series star trek next generation was my first space date and since then ive switched partners regularly ive seenem all it seems and my favorites are «lexx» «farscape» and the new «battlestar galactica» in other words the newest state of the art space operas but i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones the cheap ones like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show «blakes7» here the budgets are smaller than hobbits the special effects seem to be made on a commodore 64 but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor the acting dead serious and at times even high classbr br but why do they always speak english in the space future because this is not the future its fantasy for kids still it can be irritating at times me being a norwegian have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series like science fiction for scandinavian viewers i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened but it did actually once and even in my own homeland norway i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret tv theater section of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer the stowawaybr br when i first heard of it i was not surprised of the fact that until this day the show has only been screened once in norway making it impossible for me to actually see it it went on swedish danish and finnish television also in its time but that was a long time ago there have been no video or dvd release of it not a surprise either and when it was screened on an art house cinema this happened in bergen a city far far away from oslo where i live and then theres another fact about «blindpassasjer» that didnt surprise me that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor åge bringsværd and jon bing bingbringsværd this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose in my opinion bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers and has written several great and entertaining novels masterpieces even some of them hilarious such as «bazar» and «syvsoverskens dystre frokost» no other than this guy also an acclaimed dramatist could construct the script of «blindpassasjer»br br when i finally got to watch it it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80s eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me he was a nice bloke so i sat down and watched it with swedish subtitles bad sound and some scrapes and errors but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love itbr br the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes7 and the credit goes to caprino studios who made the famous flåklypa grand prix and the interior of the marco polo the space ship works better than id expected the acting is typically theatrical but it works better than when they play ibsen to put it mildly and bjørn floberg carries his role solidly as does trini lund the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre but this is an ensemble play and im happy to say that ola b johannesen carries his mustache with nobility and marit østbye is a really hot space chic of my standardsbr br but is it really that good well one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending the pretentious criticism of «modern society» but yes its well not really really really fantastic but charming cool nostalgic and pleasant one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi
