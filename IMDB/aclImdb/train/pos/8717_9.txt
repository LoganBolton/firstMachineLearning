i have to admit right off the top im not a big fan of family films these days most of them imho are sentimental crap but this one like toy story the previous film from pixar is a lot of fun the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too blandespecially compared to the two leads in antz but otherwise this film is better but the rest of the film more than made up for it the animation looked great the humor though broad was consistently goodi especially liked hoppers line if i hadnt promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldnt kill you i would kill you and the actors doing the voices except the two leads were all terrificdenis leary doing an animated movie what a concept and like everyone else i loved the outtakes i hope the video has the new ones
