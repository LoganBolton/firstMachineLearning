all of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of disney studios last productions here comes something that should heal your wounds once and for all a bugs life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake handmadeolddisneyslike drawings see the lion king pocahontas and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that bambis magical background and atmosphere are gone foreverbr br a bugs life 1001 pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks  succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say hey this thing is computer generated  no weak parts a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets an astonishing 3d bird close to perfection in its imitation of reality and thats only to mention the technical aspectsbr br the scenario my friends the real backbone of a motion picture has some thickness  curiously and obviously thanks to lasseters team there is practically no musical sequence in a bugs life which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate but most others dislike same thing for the parents or the anime fans like me this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase  the 3 amigos  it had basically the same background story a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen who finally turn to be actors to protect them etc simple but efficient and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insectsbr br since microcosmos many movies tell tales of insects their lives fears and hopes but i do think that a bugs life is the funniest and best directed of all the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved and the whole audience was captivated by fliks aka tilt in france adventuresbr br a big thank you for lasseters team especially for the last 30 seconds its so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugsactors forget their lines or hit the camerabr br and finally especially for those of you who have seen the french version other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie a bugs life is a really good piece of entertainment and i think it will soon become part of my collection of videos a privilege granted to extremely few movies and thats not a problem of storage room  go and see it thats an order
