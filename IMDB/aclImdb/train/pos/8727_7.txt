bugs life is a good film but to me it doesnt really compare to movies like toy story and stuff dont get me wrong i liked this movie but it wasnt as good as toy story the film has the visuals the laughs and others that toy story had but the film didnt feel quite as i dont know but i thought it was still a pretty good film br br a bugs life i dont want to say this is a film that i dont remember i saw it years ago of course i havent seen toy story in years but i still remember it i shouldnt have reviewed this film but i am i am giving it a thumbs up though its not exactly the best work pixar has donebr br a bugs life
