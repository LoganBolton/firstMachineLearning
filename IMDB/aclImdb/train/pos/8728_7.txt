pixar has had massive success over the years with the fulllength cgi animated movies they have made a bugs life was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far preceded by the companys featurelength debut the groundbreaking toy story which was the first ever featurelength cgi movie i remember when this followup was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990s but i never actually saw it until november 2006 i watched it twice that month and over three years later i have seen it a third time it has never impressed me as much as probably any other pixar film ive ever seen but after three viewings i still think its better than some of the films ive seen from dreamworks animationbr br ant island is the home of a colony of ants these ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year one member of this colony is flik an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions even though he doesnt mean to one year when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it the grasshopper leader hopper decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season but they will have to double their offering flik suggests to the colonys royal council that he goes and finds warrior bugs to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back princess atta the future queen lets him go on this mission just so he wont be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering the inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors but after he takes them back to ant island and introduces them he learns that they are actually not warriors but circus bugsbr br the main reason why this second pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters to me none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have and generally seem a bit bland fortunately however its not like shark tale a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character a bugs life does have a likable enough main character one which viewers can root for the story also seems somewhat bland at times but for the most part its good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining and sometimes has some good suspense especially later on the humour like certain other aspects of the film isnt as good as it could have been but there are definitely funny moments some of them involving francis a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female you can always expect great animation from pixar and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception with all this movie has to offer it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to pixar standards but it is reasonable family entertainment
