when watching a bugs life for the first time in a long while i couldnt help but see the comparisons with last years happy feet as far as the main storyline goes they are very similar an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixars sophomore effort sure it doesnt manage to capture the splendor of toy story nor is the animation out of this world however the story is topnotch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot i could watch this one just as much as the studios other classicsbr br there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here between our lead flick needing to keep his selfesteem up to save his colony the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons he is not doing it to be mean but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth it is very much a circle of life but not one that cant evolve with the agesbr br when thinking about the animation it is actually quite good compared to antz the rival film of the time this is much more realistic and less cartoony the water is rendered nicely as is the foliage you dont have to look much further than the ants eyes to see how much detail went into the production the reflections and moistness despite the smooth exterior shows the realism all the bugs are finely crafted too the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on whether for a small role or a more expanded one it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments while ant island is nice it is just the outdoors bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything from the ice cube trays as circus stands the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a times square of billboards and facades everything is done rightbr br as far as much of the humor you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices no one could do a male ladybug better than dennis leary with his acerbic wit i dare you to think of someone better our leads are great too with dave foley as flick and julia louisdreyfus as princess atta as well as the alwaysfantastic kevin spacey as hopper spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits yes a bugs life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar a tradition that has continued on with many tongueincheek bug jokes laced throughout you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast full of those guy actors it is people like richard kind brad garrett and the late joe ranft as heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughsbr br overall it may be the simplest story brought to screen by pixar one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience there are joyous moments sad times and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters tuck and roll there isnt too much bad that i can think of saying about it
