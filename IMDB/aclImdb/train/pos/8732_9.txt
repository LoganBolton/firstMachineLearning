lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinsons early bean performances and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages in a way that just makes you feel good a bugs life has that same charm it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects because even though they talk they still act just like real bugs its like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them to imagine bugs the way a young mind doesbr br honey i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger and to me a bugs life is like a more realistic version of that movie if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of storytelling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made because the story of a bugs life is not quite as good as toy storys but then again almost nothing is the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun br br the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society mostly geared around building a harvest of food most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers vastly superior in strength and general meanness and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food the consequences will be dire and incidentally the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tsetungs vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forwardÂ…br br the fun and excitement begins when flik the main character sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers you see he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger so he feels its his responsibility but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers great for the audience not so great for the safety of the clan br br the movie was released back in the late 90s when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos like armageddon and deep impact independence day and the arrival a bugs life and antz etc comparisons between a bugs life and antz are inevitable although it seems clear to me that a bugs life is by far the superior film and not only because it doesnt star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role this is great family fun
