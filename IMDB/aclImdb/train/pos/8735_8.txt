such a joyous world has been created for us in pixars a bugs life were immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when its in the right hands that is  a bugs life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalibre film productionsbr br it is only pixars second animated feature the subgroup of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the filmbr br after all its a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bugs life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounterbr br not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters  but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his anticsbr br the problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands however its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppersbr br if you think about it a bugs life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of akira kurosawas classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone villagedweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help comes in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a barroom brawlbr br much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs onscreen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact onscreen as is the entire movie collectivelybr br as ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bugs life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kidfriendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like however its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this filmbr br although a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bugs life other than see it its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year  and ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of 1998br br 8510
