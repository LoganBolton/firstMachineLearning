critically people say that antz is better antz is a good film but i enjoyed bugs life a bit more i cant remember a pixar animation other than the two toy story films that i was laughing so hard the animation is clean the story is original and doesnt preach the voice overs are what make this movie dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey as is haydn panettiere as dot  there is also sterling support from dennis leary david hyde pierce and madeline kahn and i could go on and on the script is fantastic so funny and sometimes even touching it lacks the social messages of antz but what we have is rocksolid entertainment 910 bethany cox
