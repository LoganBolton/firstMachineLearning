i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it i loved it a very good tight plot an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly fat deaf girl and the excon and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried br br a much much better film than the same directors de battre mon coeur sest arreté which was boring and unbelievablebr br the only thing that didnt quite work was that the supposedly ugly fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid certainly and far from conventionally beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it superb i wish she was in more films and better ones than she generally is ive seen a bit of gilles wife and a bit of the moustache and they both looked like rubbish and ive seen all of de battre mon coeur sest arreté and that certainly is rubbish she seems to have a few coming up so ill keep my fingers crossed
