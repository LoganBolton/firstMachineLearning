a bugs life is like a favorite candy bar  its chockfull of great little bits that add up to something really tastybr br the story couldnt have been better its clever has heart emotion and every character has a nice arc a growth or change by comparison the only characters in toy story to have an arc are buzz who learns to love being a toy and woody who overcomes his resentment of buzz there are tons of laughs and cute moments in a bugs life all of the actors turn in great voice work and the animation both the motion and detail is superbbr br this serious movie buff doesnt throw around 10s lightly but this movie certainly deserves the 10 i gave it
