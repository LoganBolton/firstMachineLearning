originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bugs life was too much too fasthe was dazed and exhausted by the visuals and seemed to ignore the story completelybr br okay first off im 26 years old have a job go to school and have a fiance so maybe im nuts and just really good at hiding itbut not only did i not come away from a bugs life exhausted or dazed it wasnt until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visualsbecause the first time i went to see this movie i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being wowed by each frame visually how can you not empathize with flik and his roadtoheckpavedwithgoodintentions life heck indeed i found myself identifying with that little ant not to mention some of the other bugs in a lot more ways than oneand that in itself says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy of course its beautiful every blade of grass the tree the rain of course what they can do with technology is amazing you can read their lips try it but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color no a bugs life would be static if it were all that and no story but im glad to say its not a bugs life has real heart yes theres a lot going on storylinewise as well as visually but thats because the story and characters actually have some depth to them just because its a kids movie doesnt mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre doorkids are smarter than you think besides that i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves even before their kidsand it shows in the amount of heart in has this movie is moving touching funny intriguing and generally engrossing the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing theres a major amount of character growth and not just of the main characterso rare in animation and often in movies in general it doesnt hit you over the head with its points once its made themevery scene every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there and there are no gratuitous shots not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety to me folks it means not dumbing down your movie and assuming the audience is stupid which it mostly is not all i can think is if you can see a bugs life and not feel anything at all then you must have never made a big mistake hurt your friends had a crush fallen in love been frustrated that no one would listen to you lied to someone you care about felt like a social misfit gotten excited over a new idea come up with a great idea had what you thought was a great idea backfire been awkward one moment and confident the next felt the pressure of responsibility stood up for yourself and your loved ones stood alone against the crowd felt like a failure felt like a big success felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of otherswell you get the point final words a rating from me please if youre going to see it try to see it in the theatre pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie if you loved toy story youll most likely love this pixar knows how to make movies with heart if you do love it see it multiple times or you still wont know what youre missing the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable and whenever youre feeling really low just pretend its a seed okay
