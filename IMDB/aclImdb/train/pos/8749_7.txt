i loved the movie but like everyone said there were some bits that werent developed enough i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure they were supposed to be innocent american girls but stilli felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have for example in the montage where theyre sightseeing the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkwardlookingbr br then there are some parts that were very ambiguous i think its pretty much understood that danes character didnt do it but i can see how that could be confusing also why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk i thought it was suggesting something but it turned out to be nothingbr br apart from that the movie was great i cried when claire danes took the blame shes a great actressbr br also i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked talk about lack of closure
