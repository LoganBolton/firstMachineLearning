two adventurous teenagers best friends take a trip to thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college it seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to hong kong and puts drugs in their luggage they get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in asia is very different from justice in the usbr br this is the main story line for brokedown palace and it was a good one the film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations actually the portrayal was rather mild as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted it serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the worldbr br unfortunately there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story the whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy to think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheadsbr br the story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in alices claire danes backpack did she actually agree to transport the drugs we are left to guess it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls innocence throughout the film but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty except for this considerable flaw the ending was excellent and the results unexpectedbr br the acting by claire danes and kate beckinsale was very solid and well done danes who has been oversold and over hyped actually arrived as an actor in this film though her portrayal was frequently immature as was her character she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire beckinsale in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goodytwoshoes who suddenly finds herself in prison hers was the best performance in the filmbr br bill pullman was miscast as the lawyer his wry and diffident style is an asset in films like while you were sleeping but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice he had the wrong personalitybr br the tourists look at thailand was interesting but it didnt make me want to go therebr br overall an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes i gave it a 710
