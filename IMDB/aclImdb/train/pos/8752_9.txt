i have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now brokedown palace has that hard to believe aspect however with the ingenious directing and screenplay Â‘palace scores big br br  ive really never enjoyed watching claire danes in any of her movies but ill tell you what she really changed my mind with this one kate beckinsale joins danes on a vacation to thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to hong kong with him however he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him well ultimately they get caught and end up in a thailand prison i know i know how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs well if you can get by that one tiny miscue you will find a very well written and acted out story lately i have found myself getting drawn into the storylines of the movies i watch and developing a personal feeling for the characters that i watch this movie is no different by the end of the movie i found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film br br  bill pullman plays hank green an attorney who lives in thailand and specializes in international relations as always pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully br br  there are a few twists and turns that will by the end of the movie have you in tears this is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home it is my opinion that the next time out at the video store do not pass by this one again
