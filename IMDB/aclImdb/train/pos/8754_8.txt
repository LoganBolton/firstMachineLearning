i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didnt feel very goodbr br i ended up liking it big time its a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship unwanted betrayal power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jailbr br the acting is on its prime level two of the women that i lust the most star and thats a good thing claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualitiesbr br there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience plus it shows the difficult times at thailandbr br this is an underrated movie not many films like this one have come up in recent history it should make you reflex about many things
