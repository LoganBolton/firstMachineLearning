its refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie and then be surprised when that doesnt happen i like a happy ending as much as the next guy but sometimes its better to portray things in a more realistic manner and i thought brokedown palace did this very wellbr br the ending with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place was very moving i almost rather would have done without the last line which proved that she didnt actually do the deed she confessed to because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime whether she did it or not wasnt that importantbr br the story itself bordered on the clich√© but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances very realistic very captivatingbr br 7 out of 10
