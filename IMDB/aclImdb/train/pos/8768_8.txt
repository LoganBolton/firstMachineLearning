i saw this film at a store in the cheap section i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago i thought what the hey and bought it basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fanbr br so its about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok get busted for narcotics which they are innocent of and then are sent to a thailand prison the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocencebr br both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally and raises some nice moral discussion questionsbr br i think this is a solid good film but there could have been some improvements it could have been longerit wouldve helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailands justice system wouldve helpedbr br nevertheless other than that its a good film with some great performancesbr br ps for all you popculture junkies be on the lookout for a twominute role by paul walker i didnt even notice him the first time i saw the film
