gentleman jim is another case of print the legend with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath its as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynns the charge of the light brigade  this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walshs vivid direction flynn is still at the height of his powers youd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure this time as flynns father jack carson takes sidekick duties this time indeed even the pirate galleon from flynns earlier movies makes a somewhat outofplace cameo in a dockside bout the 103 minutes just breeze by
