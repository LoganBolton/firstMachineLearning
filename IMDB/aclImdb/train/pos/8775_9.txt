excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances its often cited as his best and i cant really judge fully until i have seen his dawn patrol however his work in they died with their boots on takes some beating im a big flynn fan hes my favourite actor after james masonit also helps that hes an aussie and i think hes just marvellous a great screen presence and also a great actor he is the centrepiece of gentleman jim as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork but he is also backed up by a literate warm and funny script and raoul walshs direction every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of its pace he truly was a born filmmaker walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant great final scene between ward bord and flynn add to that great production values the gay nineties never looked better and a lovely supporting cast and its pretty much perfect entertainment alan hale usually played flynns sidekick but here is his father and it still all works alexis smith is flynns love interest the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other
