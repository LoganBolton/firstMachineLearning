if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett then this is probably not the film for you the famed boxer receives a 1940s hollywoodization of his lifemaking the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life however because the performances were so good particularly by errol flynn and the script so likable the films embellishments can be forgivenbr br errol flynn plays gay ninetiesera boxer james gentleman jim corbetta man who became world boxing champ in 1892 the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l sullivan however while it could have focused mostly on the matches most are rather brief in the film except for the final title match and the emphasis is on corbetts brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith throughout the film there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films alan hale and the writing really helped bring these people alivebr br what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer while a few of the shots are of doubles almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist this was a nice departure for flynn who generally played pretty boy roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was to find out more about this try reading a biography of himhe was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywoodbr br now as for the real james corbett read on if you arent afraid of finding out how the movie isnt accurate first corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family but was college educated and bright second while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film they also divorced a few years later third the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happenedin reality sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fatheaded guy they portrayed in the filmthough it made for a lovely film
