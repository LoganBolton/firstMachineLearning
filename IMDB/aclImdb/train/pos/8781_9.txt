i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling gentleman jim the best boxing movie ever made that is the robert wisepaul newman flick somebody up there likes me that movie might be number 1 but gentleman jim is a close number 2br br the movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of james j corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bareknuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved marquis of queensbury rules and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectabilitybr br gentleman jim is not a realistic look at those days it is romanticized and yes even a bit hokey at times but always delightfully so errol flynn is perfect as the gentleman jim who really isnt a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a lovehate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the endbr br at the end of gentleman jim the great john l sullivan whose famous line was not i can lick any man in the world of courseromanticism again hands over his belt to corbett this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made realistic no but wonderful hey if you want realism watch raging bull instead that is a much more realistic boxing movie but gentleman jim is a lot more fun
