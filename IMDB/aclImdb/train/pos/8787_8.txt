this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his savoirfaire and sprezzatura to throw in a couple of highfalutin european terms this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent everyone seems wellchosen for their rolesbr br the story moves briskly and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco all in all theres little not to like about this filmvery well worth the time to watch it
