well i am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on dvd when that will happen i dont know but i will grab it when its releasedbr br in my humble opinion this is errol flynns most entertaining film especially when gentleman jim corbetts ring career begins in the film then it goes from a good film to a great onebr br few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that reportedly this was flynns favorite role and i believe that you can just sense how much fun he was having here ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l sullivan bond too was never betterbr br there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done too corbetts family is fun to watch too as they carry on in the stands during jims matches out of the arena corbetts familys constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusionbr br and speaking of the conclusion sullivans speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film some meanspirited critics variety for example didnt like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but  duh  most films are fictionalized like it or not and in this case it made for a nice story and nice ending in real life corbett was a very softspoken true gentleman not anything like flynns portrayal but flynn still make him a good guybr br this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd
