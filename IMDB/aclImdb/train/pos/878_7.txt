interesting characters lots of tension as close to black and white without being black and white i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own getaway im a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury theyve done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks in this film we never know whos money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deafsecretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot too bad the film could have been great
