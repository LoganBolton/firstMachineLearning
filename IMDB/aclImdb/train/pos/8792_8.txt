an entertaining kung fu film with acting plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists alexander fushengs protojackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills for me the films only glaring flaw is the size of the cast  at times things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots and some of the characters are not as fully fleshedout as one might wishbr br but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count the film climaxes with a highbodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponentbr br overall shaolin temple is an enjoyable lowbudget kung fu movie not up to the quality of a good jet li film but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre my rating 810br br misc notes the 1987 warner home video release i saw was predictably poorly dubbed and lacked full cast  crew credits
