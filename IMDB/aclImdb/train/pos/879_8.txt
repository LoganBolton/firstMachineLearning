after erasing my thoughts nearly twentyseven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiards subtle yet inspirational love story thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items  but it is moremuch much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frighteningbr br as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul played exquisitely by vincent cassel a slickedback hair mustachewearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun  and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival coworker paul helps her carlas ability to read peoples lips comes in handy for a makeshift idea for paul the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never does audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film yet none of this could have happened if it werent for our characters devos solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shapebr br audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a whodunit mystery unfold before your eyesbr br overall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in pauls apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isnt a one time viewing film repeat repeat repeatbr br grade  out of
