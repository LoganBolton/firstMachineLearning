this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice each short exploring the global reverberations of 911 without using any spoilers i would say that ken loachs piece is the jewel in the crown and mira nairs short segment india based on a true story deserves to be made into a full feature film one also realizes while watching his short why alejandro gonzález iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today  he simply is a master of the medium who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter unfortunately not all 11 parts are made as well youssef chahine in his segment egypt assumes the arab stance of the selfinflicted collective guilt which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one he fails miserably chahines short is poorly written and badly executed at least enough to stand out amongst other superior chapters of the film despite the imbalance in quality i would still give the film 710 for concept if not for execution
