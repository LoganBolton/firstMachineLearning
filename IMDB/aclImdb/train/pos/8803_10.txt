i just recently watched this on the sundance channel the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers illustrious in their own country to make short films eleven of them all in one film concentrating on just one subject september 11br br from wacthing this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great filmbr br the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september 11 which they fail to realize until laterbr br the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the tv playsbr br the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 911 but bombings in other placesbr br the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september 11 and believes they must march for thembr br the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin ladinbr br the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that daybr br the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacksbr br there are other films that i cant remember at the moment but all of them are powerful it will bring back your emotions from that daybr br 1010
