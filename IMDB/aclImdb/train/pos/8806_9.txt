i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous the collection works as intended it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions working as an intellectual hommage never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor kneejerk reactionismbr br there have been many allegations made that the film is antiamerican while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue people make much noise about the egyptian segment by chahine because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are fair targets for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack but this ignores much else in the piece several perspectives are discussed no one being held up as the truth and criticsif they even saw the pieceseem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue and the directors intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedybr br pretty much all of the films are beautiful thoughtful  inspiring in particular the brilliant work by mahkmalbaf tanovic loach  inarritu nair good as usual effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of antiislam hysteria that sweptand still sweepsthe states i did find gitais piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in its critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism and penns piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes though i had expected to like it borgnine is very good and brave in it spoiler warning one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what because light floods his room keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize again this is a sort of impressionistic piece for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this mans flat then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash not light flooding through his window
