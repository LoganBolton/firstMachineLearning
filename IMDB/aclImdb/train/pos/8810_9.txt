i first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct trio channel a few years ago and recently watched it againsans commercialson sundance i was impressed the first time and found it even more engaging on second viewing yes some of the segments are far from perfectamos gitais hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumbbut taken collectively 11 09 01 is a total success best of show shohei imamuras amazing final segment which contemporary critics such as the thickwitted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on the terrorists but now stands revealed as a masterful antiwar polemic samira makhmalbafs opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 911 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan and idrissa ouedraogos amusing childrens crusade for osama bin ladena hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama youssef chahines segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and alqaeda are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia and though sean penns character study seems out of place its still an effectively bittersweet piece of filmmaking all in all essential viewing and a darn sight better than oliver stones reactionary world trade center
