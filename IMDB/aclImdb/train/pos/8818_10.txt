it was clear right from the beginning that 911 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined however there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good or rather bad as pearl harbor it is a great luck that the first international release about 911 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire worldbr br im not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great youssef chahines for example has a needless prologue with too many cuts and shohei imamuras has a really bizarre ending or that the segments are in the right order imamuras being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers should open the film not end it alejandro gonzales inarritus should be the last one instead as its the most impressive one but it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towersbr br consider samira makhmalbafs opening segment in which an afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in new york and unsuccessfully suggests a oneminute silence or idrissa ouedraogos part which features a bin ladendouble so much resembling the real one that youll be shocked when you see him i promise in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on ladenbr br theres a surprisingly good and extremely angry segment by ken loach about a man from chile talking about what he calls our tuesday september 11  that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president allende was killed and pinochet installed his dictatorship  with the generous help from henry kissinger and the cia this could have become a terrible effort in antiamericanism but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with inarritus mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the wtc and finally a collapsing tower ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing and amos gitais about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in tel aviv hard to recognize but this one is a masterpiece of choreographybr br all these different segments i havent mentioned yet claude lelouchs about a deaf girl danis tanovics about a demonstration of the women of srebrenica mira nairs  strange but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes  about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 911 and sean penns with ernest borgnine yes ernest borgnine as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies but alas its far more probable it will be remembered as a onefilmonly effort and as the one of the few 911 movies made by then that dont reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience
