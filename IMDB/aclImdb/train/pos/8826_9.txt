if youre amused by straightfaced goingson that are logical within a given illogical situation youll enjoy this whimsical 8minute spanish filmbr br a woman enters a small caf√© the scene looks ordinary but the counterman customers and two musicians seem somehow oddly subduedbr br suddenly the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song  dancing across table tops with musicalcomedy gestures the customers at first immobile at intervals chime in badly but gamely with phrases from the song read from slips of paper in their palms on and off they jump up and dance awkwardly but earnestly in choreographed motions like backup singersbr br but why the woman wonders the answer is revealed as the soloists jacket opens and she sees whats strapped across his chest  just before the explosive climaxbr br even if you dont catch the songs probably ironical lyrics the situationperfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle id love to see it again
