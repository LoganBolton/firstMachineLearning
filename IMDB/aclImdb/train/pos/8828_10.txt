i was so glad i came across this short film im always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting forbr br the plot is pretty simple the director writer and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchybr br its a well made short film well edited and the actors all do a great job and the last shot of the film is perfectbr br i highly recommend this film
