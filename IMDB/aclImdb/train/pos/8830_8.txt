this is a masterpiece footage in bw 35mm film the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 735 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutesbr br the short amazingly gets you in a complex story using very little elements and step to step makes you realize that something isnt totally right it expresses a lot makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details and is incredibly understandable by anyone not just the cinema critics expertsbr br but i know how it sounds  european short black and white and low budgeted dont let that scare you is really worth to see by anyone not just experts in the genrebr br isnt really much more to tell since the film just lasts 8 minutes exactly and i dont want to spoil it but i just watched it online and i couldnt understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about itbr br really worth watching it 1010
