hey babu riba is a film about a young woman mariana nicknamed esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn sacha kicha and pop all perhaps 1517 years old in 1953 belgrade yugoslavia the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz blue jeans or anything american it seemsbr br the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties in the wake of changing communist politics they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 the year before the film was madebr br i enjoyed the film with some reservations the subtitles for one thing were difficult especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all perhaps the conversational pace required it but i couldnt always both read the text and absorb the scene which caused me to not always understand which character was involved i watched the movie a video from our public library with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relativebr br this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers sense of invulnerability idealism and strong and loyal bonds to each other there is a main flashforward and it was intriguing keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were visavis the 1953 cast and what had actually happenedbr br i would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by the director jovan acin 19411991
