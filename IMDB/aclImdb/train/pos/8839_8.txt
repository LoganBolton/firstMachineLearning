thank god this wasnt based on a true story because what a story it is populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds before the devil is a mesmerizing jawdropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable and sometimes is even with  or perhaps because of  the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout if it werent carried out with such magnificent overwhelming conviction by its stars the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesnt hurt eitherbr br the main dysfunction here is of a family nature with the two majorly screwed up brothers brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke deciding to rob their own parents jewelry store an attempt that goes pathetically awrybr br the story is told with timeshifts which are noted on screen such as charlie two days before the robbery so no one should be confused some people have said they didnt like this device but i thought it worked perfectly adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks  between them you couldnt make a decent poker hand to save your life throw in these cheesy extra tidbits one of the brothers is a drug addict married to gina marisa tomei also excellent who is having an affair with the other brother toss in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father a wrenching performance from albert finney who has apparently caused him serious past pain and youve got a shakespeareangreek tragedy on your hands proceed with caution
