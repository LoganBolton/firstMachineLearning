watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film  and for me the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience it is one of those films that has stayed with me and i continue to ponder and think about itbr br surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the filmmaking elements which include sidney lumets comeback movie the timeshifting technique deployed in the storytelling the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well the masterly direction the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women the underpresented but nevertheless resonant marisa tomeis performance and of course the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts  for me the heart of the moviebr br phew surely a masterful film so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd  only to find no commentary no behindthescenes no interviews no extrasbr br hey  distributors  sort it out
