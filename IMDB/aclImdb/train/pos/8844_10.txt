this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong a simple robbery pick up some serious change get our finances together and everything will be hunkydory butmom and pops jewelry store no problem insurance pays for it all no guns nobody gets hurt easy moneybr br older more successful it would appear brother andy philip seymour hoffman has a few minor problems heroin addiction cocaine habituation a wife marisa tomei thatwell he cant seem to perform for his flat belly days long gone younger sweet slightly dimwitted younger brother hank ethan hawke with a few dinero problems of his own behind in child support payments for his daughter in debt to friends and relatives not exactly wowing them in the work of work etcbr br sydney lumet in this performance at the age of 82  directs and gets it 9999 percent right which is hard to do in a thriller i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes the improbabilities the cheesy scenes and the hurryup ending here lumet makes a thriller like its a work of art every detail is perfect the acting is superb the plot has no holes the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himselfbr br hoffman of course is excellent when you dont have marquee leading man presence you have to get by on talent workmanship and pure concentration ethan hawke who is no stranger to the sweet little guy role adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we dont know whether to pity him or trash him albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age and marisa tomei who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andys two timing wife but who could blame her its almost a movie reviewers sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars but if you study this film as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do you will notice the kind of excessive according to most hollywood producers attention to detail that makes for real artthe sort of thing that only great artists can do and indeed cannot help but do by the way i think there were twenty producers on this filmwell maybe a dozen check the credits all i can say in summation is way to go sydney lumet author of a slew of excellent films and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos may we all do half so wellbr br okay the 0001 percent it was unlikely that the father albert finney could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail this is minor and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end we can guess and guess perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out and he just said leave it like that it really doesnt matter and i think it doesnt what happens to hank is not going to be good he isnt the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life he is the kind of guy who gets a light sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasnt really a man when he should have beenbr br see this for sidney lumet one of hollywoods best director of the pawnbroker 1964 the group 1966 serpico 1973 dog day afternoon 1975 network 1976 and many more
