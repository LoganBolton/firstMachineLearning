i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesnt let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end trust me this movie will keep you guessing the entire way throughbr br the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant its almost like a more complicated tarantino type story the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast i also loved the cinematography it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film it was all greatbr br this movie is excited exhausting and heartbreaking its almost hard to watch but youll be glad that you did
