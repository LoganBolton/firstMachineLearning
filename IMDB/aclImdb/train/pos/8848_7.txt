i watched this film in a very strange way  i had put it on my netflix list and couldnt remember why other than that i knew philip seymour hoffman was in it since the film has no opening credits i couldnt even remember who had directed itbr br as my wife and i watched it i turned to her about 45 minutes in and said you know i keep wanting to decide that i hate this film but something about it just wont let me stop watching it then theres a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors performancesbr br it was only as the end credits rolled that i realized it was a sidney lumet film and i thought  wow im surprised that lumet took on what was really a dirty petty little story about really mean broken people but its a testament to his talent that i was so taken in when i didnt even realize it was himbr br philip seymour hoffman is really really good in this movie like scary good put this up against capote and i would argue the oscar should have been for this film insteadbr br i also highly recommend the narrative special feature with lumet hawke and hoffman talking about making the movie  its entertaining and educational with hawke playing the student eager to learn at the masters feet lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors  kiss their asses constantlybr br there are a lot of violent melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done and there is an element of that in this film  that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion and when the smoke clears theres nothing left nothing resonates on a deeper levelbr br but lumet has given us network and twelve angry men  films that each in their own ways have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinemabr br this movie isnt at that level but theres something about it that lingers and maybe thats enoughbr br my final comment is about the comments  if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on imdb  and the depth and intelligence of the comments pro and con  its a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film
