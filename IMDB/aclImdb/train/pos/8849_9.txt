the hanson brothers  andy apparently has his act together and hank clearly doesnt have his act together need money andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole hanson familybr br this film delivers this is a layered fullblooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing as a crime drama  thriller i would happily compare it to no country for old men while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills devil is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace no country is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while devil is a bit more enjoyable there is definitely less violence in devil than no country the acting delivers as well ethan hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deerintheheadlightslook to the besieged hank philip seymour hoffman as andy has the films hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anythingbr br theres really not much wrong with this film it jumps back and forth without being confusing events spiral out of control but the film never does  the writing from first timer kelly masterson directing veteran sidney lumet and the editing stay as tight as a drum in many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like the departed and no country squeezed this one out of the limelight if you liked those youll like this
