tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called backstreet that tragedy is like another character in the film the same could be said and not withstanding bringing up tarantino for sidney lumets best work in years a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of whats at stake with the cast involved kelly masterson doesnt have a masterpiece of a script here it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount but her script does convey character before plot and in a story where the actions surround a heist its crucial to know who these people are beat by beat its bleak as hell unforgiving as satan but also absolutely riveting 90 of the timebr br chalk it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a nonlinear script where we see the daytoday actions of character to character before during and mostly after the botched mompop jewelry store robbery occurs but because of the formidable cast assembled which i might add is lumets specialty philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial fups and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a foolproof heist looting their own mother and fathers jewelry store in westchester hawkes hank involves another shady character though murders occur and suddenly its tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father played by a perfect albert finney its the kind of material that most actors love characters who like in dog day afternoon are painfully human flawed to the bone but only wanting love or things to be set right and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needsbr br in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched splendidly hoffman has until the aforementioned last ten minutes a supercalm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally ie with finney or the car scene with tomei push his talents to the limit hawke meanwhile is called a loser by his exwife and daughter cant pay any debts at all and is called a baby by his own father and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter hes not quite as flawed as his older brother but who wants to pick a straw for that title and finney as mentioned is spoton all the way through making his turn in big fish look like childs play the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second halfbr br also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely twotiming marisa tomei bugs michael shannon as badass white trash and amy ryan brian f obyrne and rosemary harris making brief exact impressions this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart but not a forgiving heart with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a familys perpetual downward spiral if its not as mindblowing as serpico or network or the pawnbroker or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything lumets done since
