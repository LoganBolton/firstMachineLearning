sydney lumet although one of the oldest active directors still got game a few years ago he shot find me guilty a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director if he had retired after this movie a true masterpiece in my eyes no one could have blamed him but hes still going strong his next movie already announced for 2009br br but lets stay with this movie right here the cast list is incredible their performance top notch the little nuances in their performances the real dialogue andor situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing the time structure of the movie that keeps your toes the whole time blending timelines so seamlessly that the editing seems naturalflawless the story is heightened by that although even in a normal time structure it wouldve been at least a good movie dramathriller i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you o
