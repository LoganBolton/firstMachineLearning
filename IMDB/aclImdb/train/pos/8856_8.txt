before the devil knows youre dead starts off promisingly setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in rashomon style at around the hour mark sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually morphs into a multifaceted family drama exploring the full realm of human emotionsrelations as the story comes to its chilling climaxbr br as is the case with lumet he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his starstudded cast without any notion of overacting or hyperbole philip seymour hoffman in one of his best roles is a complex mysterious and interesting character and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke who plays his brother hank thats not to say that hawke is not bad in fact he is quite above adequate in a troubled role that suits his style marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this albert finneys character andy and hanks father is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserved a bit more screentime amy ryan also performs her job adequatelybr br before the devil knows youre dead is not an exceptional movie but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the apparent twilight of an illustrious career many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here not least of which involves the use of his characters infused with a killer script no pun intended smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score before the devil knows youre dead is a mustsee a truly underrated gem 810 3 stars out of 4 should just enter my top 250 at 248 highly recommended
