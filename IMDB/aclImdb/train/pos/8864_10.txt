what an extraordinary crime thriller my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival its already my second favourite film of alltime after dr strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wifebr br i dont want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions a synopsis that id feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester new york the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time before during and after the robbery and one key scene is repeated at least three times ordinarily that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece the excitement the tension and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed by the end i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up i know that ive used a few clichés in this post but i literally was on the edge of my seat i should mention that the nonlinear storyline is quite easy to follow this isnt the sort of movie where youll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the moviebr br the acting is absolutely brilliant allaround and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadnt been so perfect a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke dont look like brothers but thats a minor quibble that i can easily overlook hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric marisa tomei as hoffmans wife and albert finney as the father of hoffman  hawke are also very good in supporting roles even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark gesture and facial expression by brian obyrne and michael shannon  absolute perfection the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene ive ever watched and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes especially the ones with hoffman the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie often the same notes played over very effectively i had the music playing in my head the following day even as i sat through other films in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable major spoiler so i cant describe the scene otherwise this film is pretty darn close to perfectbr br there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows youre dead stands in a league of its own as an aside the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage tomei didnt speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camerashy that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene
