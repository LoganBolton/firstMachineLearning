cosby in my opinion is a mustsee cbs hit im not sure if ive never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it its hard to say which one is my favorite also i really loved the theme song if you ask me even though i liked everyone it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadnt passed away during the shows run since that happened ive always wondered what the show would have been like everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tbs now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
