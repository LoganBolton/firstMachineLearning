when john singleton is on hes on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as boyznthehood but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot theres very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial eg where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why doesnt professor phibbs have an office a professor of his stature should have one and while were at it for an engineering student hick or not remys a pretty dumb character  id think that hed have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence  he talks and acts like a total buffoonbr br but that aside the film was very sharp a good array of characters and points of view and singleton doesnt take sides in the story  many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sidesbr br much of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well also the malikdeja scenes were really well shot as wellbr br the dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness we really didnt need the us flag with unlearn typed onto it give some credit were not morons and to top it off although most of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well sometimes it gets way too cheezy like dejas death which is fine until she screams out why which simply ruined the entire effect and scenebr br but the acting in general was top of the line fabulous performances by omar epps perhaps the best ive ever seen kirsty swanson who knew buffy could act michael rapaport surprised the hell out of meafter true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a onerole actor and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstandingbr br downside jennifer connelly was flat though its not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and onedimensional generic to the highest degree and tyra banks who had the role was nothing short of horrid she whined and whined and whined yet another in the long line of modelsturnedactresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rulebr br finally the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a glove each scene has a twin song although the tori amos songs started to really annoy me by the endnot her best work liz phair rage against the machine ice cubehow can one go wrongbr br all in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film 810
