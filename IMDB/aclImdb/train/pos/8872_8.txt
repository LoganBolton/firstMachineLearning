this is the first movie ive seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly who is a lesbian and isnt sure about which way to go michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neonazis and their leader is cole hauser those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them its a great film and its unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie
