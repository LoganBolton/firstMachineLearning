of life in some colleges of course there were artistic licenses taken but some of what you saw in this film go on in some collegesbr br i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own its funny because these are schools that want racial unity equality etc and i can honestly say that its there but the thing is when class lets out or when theyre just hanging out waiting for class they students seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity is that bad not really everyone needs a feeling of belonging but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them otherwise youre creating your own segregationbr br racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations fortunately nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gatheringbr br i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happenbr br so is higher learning overly dramatic exaggerated maybe is it way off mark it depends on where you went to or go to school the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen minus the hollywood exaggerations the race thing hit pretty close to home for me
