first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in 1995 rappers were in it and that added to the flair of itbr br remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldnt until he met and was befriended by nazis they took him in nazis arent all this awkward but like most gangs they fill a void that is missing be it economic social emotional whatever michael rappaport played the part perfectlybr br omar epps was the hot shot track star with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on itbr br kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in until she was date raped she then found her self experiment with her sexuality and getting involved politicallybr br this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism peoples own perspectives come into playbr br i read so many comments about how there were no evil black characters but there were evil white one nazis so what remy wasnt portrayed as evil at all he was trying to find his way and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him he was scared it was sad to see him devolve how he did he even says right before he kills himself i didnt mean it i wanted to be an engineerbr br ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates and generally appear to not like white people very much they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness sorry if this makes it seem unfair but are there really black groups like the nazis nobr br people say it shows whitebad blackgood not true the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police which is more or less true in real life kristen was a good girl her boyfriend omar epps roommate was a good guy and even remy was a good guy he was just misguidedbr br omar epps ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters angry and inconsiderate although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger remys inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as wellbr br good movie well done like all movies that deal with racism its a great piece to get a discussion goingbr br i dont think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though
