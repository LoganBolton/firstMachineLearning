john singletons finest film before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake this is a thoughtprovoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters each with identifiable youngster problemsbr br what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on socialeconomical problems and racism by whites this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racistbr br the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow its not just about racism but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world college date rape discovering sexuality and isolation omar epps michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez yay and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riotsbr br the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne peppermint surely plenty of professors are nutty but theyre not as flat the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature but i guess they are like that too in real lifebr br overall a great underrated piece of filmwork if you liked american history x youll love this onebr br 85 out of 10
