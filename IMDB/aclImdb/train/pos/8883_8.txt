the films design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country us we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film befittingly the obvious of student vs teacher is present but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male vs female white vs black and the individual vs society but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual vs himself br br i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides it did not attempt to show how either was right although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive quite obvious towards the end the film also discusses sex and rape it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together for a time lawrence fishburne does an overthetop performance as the sagacious profesor phipps he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and downtrodden with the industrious and positive other stars that make this film are omar epps ice cube and jennifer connelly michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can actbr br higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper in fact i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at a university it is a lifelearning process not a textual one i think youll find higher learning is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general 810
