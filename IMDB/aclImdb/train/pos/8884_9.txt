i really enjoyed the 60s not being of that generation im waiting for the 80s it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that erabr br one major problem in the movie however was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960s america now i may have missed something but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american familybr br i really think that the 60s uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors all of which are very talented this is very visible at the end of the first part about two hours in of the miniseriesbr br very good movie
