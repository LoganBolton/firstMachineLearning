one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than youd think for this era and make the nonfight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie this is a great compliment unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chans police story i cop dramas pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china unfortunately in the latter 13 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessarybr br the action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 12 of the shaw brothers only 2 stars karleung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet lis bad guy theres only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then theres this it really takes away from the fights when its this obvious the footage was messed withbr br that said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here wont dissuade you and if you dont you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this
