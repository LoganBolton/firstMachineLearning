i can agree with other comments that there wasnt an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasnt a documentary it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at itbr br i agree with the black family the scenes with them seemed out of place like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty goodbr br despite it wasnt a reenactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch
