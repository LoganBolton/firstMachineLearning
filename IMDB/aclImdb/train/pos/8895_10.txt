i accidently felt on this movie on tv and i wasnt able to leave it its really an excellent movie which makes people learning about americans history with the vietnam war the flower powers time the racisms fight it illustrates the conflict of generation of political opinion of race which took place in the 60sim born in 1980 so i didnt know all that stuff beforein france usas history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts  by the way i think all the actors are great especially jordana brewster josh hamilton and jerry oconnell now i can see this film more then 1 time each day  its really great what a shame it only appeared on tv not in cinemasbr br
