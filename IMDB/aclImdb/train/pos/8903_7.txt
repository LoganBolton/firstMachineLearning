sure its a 50s drivein special but dont let that fool you in my little book there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor catch the redoubtable mrs porter whos supposed to keep an eye on the docs place she not only steals the scene but darn near the whole movie and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color a wise decision since the blob would not show up well in bw yes the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate but except for several of the teens the nonhollywood cast performs well then too the byplay among hotrodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage apparently they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with juvenile delinquents then again the 27year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department but manages the hotrodder attitude anyway the movie was a hit at the time helped along no doubt by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play and except for the unfortunate final effects the movie is still a lot of fun drivein or no drivein meanwhile im awaiting the blobs return now that the polar icecap is turning into shall we say refrigerator water
