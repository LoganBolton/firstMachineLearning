i had first watched this several years ago on a nowdefunct sicilian tv channel amazingly the film emerged as a heftilypriced dvd from criterion not being sure what i had made of it initially despite having attained cult status over the years the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs i opted not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and to me unfamiliar fiend without a face 1958 recently however i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which interestingly ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion special editionbut regrettably i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature anyway looking at the film anew i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it despite many a narrative flaw which i will get to later  as a pure example of bmovie schlockiness atypically shot in pleasant color and a timecapsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes the male lead was an early role for steven mcqueen and though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent and more importantly altruistic kid the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monsters invasion of a cinema showing daughter of horror 19537 as i mentioned recently in that films review but being curiously screened flipped and which sequence incidentally would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called blob as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places never being seen by anyone there is a baffling overemphasis tantamount to padding on the kids scrapes with police it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid whatever its proportion can be destroyed by bullets equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making doortodoor visits especially when considering that at that stage only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me though i know micheal elliott loves it for the record i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h harris namely 4d man 1959 and dinosaurus 1960
