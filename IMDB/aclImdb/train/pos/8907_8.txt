i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night not knowing what to expect i had heard of this movie but never really any opinions on itbr br i have to say i was impressed with what i saw i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few timesbr br the blob was scary looking now i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if itll latch itself onto my handbr br steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews the protagonist of the film i also liked the old man in the beginningbr br for a 50s horror movie this was very well done even by todays standardsbr br 810
