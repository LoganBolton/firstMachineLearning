first off i hadnt seen the blob since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s fear of teenagers but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it bebr br sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world but the blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults dont believe them in fact there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candycolored world and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in himbr br to sum up if you can take off your postmodern irony filter theres a lot more to love here than meets the eye
