the blob is a great horror movie not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable fleshdissolving title character but because it features a real societal message it is in many ways a feelgood horror film the clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast the two romantic leads steve mcqueen and aneta corsaut bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings they are misunderstood but very wellmeaning young people and its very easy to root for thembr br this is a prosociety movie and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom not out of some malevolent character flaw steve mcqueens dragracing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings but quickly joins in mcqueens campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees mcqueens seriousness in this way a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realismbr br the authorities initial skepticism of the kids wild claims is proved wrongand once the threat is acknowledged by all all conflict within the society disappears this unification of purpose and the validation of the troublemaking teens becomes official when aneta corsauts father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob on any other day breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquenton this particular day it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure at this turning point it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the oldbr br this is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a generation gap but suggests that it is more imaginary than real and that given a real crisis people will naturally band together to restore order the blob is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of night of the living dead 1968br br much has been made of the films cheap but innovative and effective visual effects they are undeniably clever a lot of the gravitydefying tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly locked down position the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turnedthe silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up in a way this was similar to stop motion photography but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet even today the effects are startling and bizarrebr br a very good film with an exploitativesounding title the blob is a mustsee
