who would think andy griffiths helen crump aneta corsaut had a steve mcqueen movie in her past but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagersbattlecreatures movie which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space the rebel is steven mcqueen who would shortly decide that steve sounded less prissy a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hotrodders but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous maneating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteorand begins gobbling up townfolk right and left but will the grown ups believe them of course not what do they know theyre just kidsbr br the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously with many a soulful look into each other eyes and the adult supporting cast probably says kids very third sentence or so but the real pleasure of the film its creature which is well imagined wellexecuted and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense and although clearly on the cheap side check out those miniature sets guys the blob is actually a fairly wellmade filmand theres that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure the 40plus crowd myself included will enjoy the movie as nostalgia but that wont prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its wholemilkandwhitebread 1950s sensibility and the film would be a great choice for either familymovie night or a more sophisticated grown ups only get together make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
