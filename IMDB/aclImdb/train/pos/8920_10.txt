i wasnt aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film id been devastated by the movie trantula at age seven    but i was ten now the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmers probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater but i stayed and suffered through each of our monsters attacks i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctors office poor doc and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience    so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors too huge now to fit through just one it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential and when it trapped poor steve in a sievelike diner he seemed like a sure dinner to be br br to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description but in the end better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kidsbr br i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick trying to act brave he knew i was in trouble and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor there the red pulsating heartlike hungry dude sat waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom it took months to recover br br im 57 years old now    ive made itbr br of course the blob wasnt destroyed
