i look at this page and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic sure i agree to let everyone have their opinion but heres minebr br this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher and should be seen many casual viewers around the world sure it has lost some of its flair and greatness with age especially in todays world of cgi effects but thats not why you should like itbr br you should like it because it actually is a scary movie even for todays standards its overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences so dont slam a classic if you havent given it a chance watch it but not with a critical attitude watch it to have fun how it was originally intended
