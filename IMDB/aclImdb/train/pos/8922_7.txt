the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueens first big starring rolebr br mcqueens talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little scifi horror piece steve shows himself as the antiestablishment hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hencebr br later on mcqueen would say he hated this film and that he was the blob but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute fresh and innocent would that we all had stayed that waybr br the plot is fast paced and although predictable still an entertaining hour or so and its really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool and anita corsaut before she became andy taylors girlfriend a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and its a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection
