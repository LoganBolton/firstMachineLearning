the blob is a classic 1950s bmovie scifi flick you probably know the story two teens steve mcqueen  aneta corsaut see a meteorite hit the ground and when they go to look for it they run into an old man with some weirdblob attached to his arm they take him to the doctors office and then go to find out what happened from there the blob spreads eating everyone in its path the special effects are cheesy fun as is the story there are a lot of great touches like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district its no masterpiece but it has a special place in its genre steve mcqueen is very good 810
