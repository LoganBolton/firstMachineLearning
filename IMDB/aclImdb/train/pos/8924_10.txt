this movie is wonderful what separates it from other 50s scifi is the fact that the alien has no features no face eyes anything yet it cant be killed i especially like the idea that this film doesnt take place over a few days it takes place in one night lasting supposedly past midnightits also scary that once the blob gets on you you cant get it off youre stuck in it as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body my all time favorite 50s scifi film and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one i can see why this rocketed steve mcqueen to stardom all this and a catchy theme song how can you go wrong
