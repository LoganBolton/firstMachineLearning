my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i cant summarize the plot but its a really superb character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom trebor unwittingly gets his new heart itd been my last film in a long long day halfway through the festival maybe id dozed the better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming dont know did know there was an ohenry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished and knew it had to do with the heart hence the quietly hilarious talent search my plotloss remark had more to do with intricacies of trebors connections in france his relation to the dog woman and so on stuff id been wide awake for denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another directors treatmentbr br but i write these things too often from memory especially festival films films whose dvd i dont have at hand le lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions still or already linrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of darkside superman a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible relatively softspoken driven but patient right among us the scar once he attains it makes him just visually i mean in image a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster mad doctor and creation all in one the actual doctors are his tools if he doesnt extract and install the heart himself its only because its not possible hes the force always the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself what else is he to suggest that hes us the first world versus the third seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow first worlders on all of usbr br deniss cameras eye  when it looks at things i know  goes usually where mine would so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i dont know snow trekking toofast bicycling and forest darkness ive known in small ways but the south seas not at all so i made better entry into lintrus both france and the crystalline isles of its finish than into beau travail lintrus is for me a very comfortable discomforting film its a sequence of places portrayed familiarly with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether weve seen the reality or not a single image trebor cycling his massive weight on the thin racing frame the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires the asphalt ribbon the darkinbrightsun evergreens cued me that the film would be linear a road trip a single willdriven thrustbr br despite trebors personal power hes a human failure no matter who hes with hes alone though apparently he hasnt always been his body aborts life twice first to need the new heart then despite it lintrus is tragedy trebor is hubrisbr br im navigating perilously the thread of what i remember lets leave it at that
