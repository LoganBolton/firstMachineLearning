two things haunt you throughout lintrus the intruder whos the intruder and is it a movie or a dream youre watching the ending is so shocking that for a while youre at a loss for an answer to either of those questions the intruder pops up as different characters different men in different circumstances who dont belong in the scene so theyre expelled from it kindly or brutally but often without emotional involvement the main character louis is a contemptible man hes got rough ways some mean job and no heart he needs one and goes after it he has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life can this man succeed in his quest for redemption a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat you know it but claire denis doesnt encourage you to judge him occasionally theres a young russian woman a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth  who does judge him she may even punish him but not denis theres the character played by beatrice dalle who wants no business with him dont touch me she says but denis lets this man be himself films him in his selfabsorbed quest i dont know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isnt the traditional plot basics whatever she films you get it in the end you know whos the intruder you know why more or less and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning but was it a movie or a dream
