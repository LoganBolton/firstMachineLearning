the intruder lintrus is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life br br grizzled michel subor plays louis trebor like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him we learn more about him through dreams flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not as well as through his brusque interactions with family lovers business associates and a striking nemesis like the limey the film resonates with parentchild regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man here paul gégauffs 1965 adventure film le refluxbr br in a complete contrast of moods we meet his son sidney grégoire colin who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby a toddler and every need of his working wife surely directorcowriter claire denis must have created him as a womans fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay theres an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining no wonder he thinks his father is a lunatic i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyesbr br the film is a puzzle but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals and the voiceover narration for deniss beau travail was annoying anyway we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva korea and the south pacific time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing br br continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson paul gauguin and marlon brandos tahiti idylls and a 40page memoir by french philosopher jeanluc nancy the last for the title and hearttransplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequencesbr br while louis thinks hes succeeded in being above boundaries rules and morals there is some amusement in the last act as the locals dont quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey even as he again lies in isolationbr br several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical but strikingly beautiful story telling method the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details
