after beau travail everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a followup masterpiece that never arrived now it has denis makes a quantum leap in this film an orgy of gorgeous cinematography elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger theres a nominal plot derived partly from the jeanluc nancy book of the same name about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a tahitian son he abandoned long ago but mostly its an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend and has pacing problems close to the end but its still more advanced and gripping than anything else ive seen this year miss it at your peril
