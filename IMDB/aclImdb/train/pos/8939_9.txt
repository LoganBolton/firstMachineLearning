a powerful adaptation of the bestselling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of bessie and sadie delany two colored sisters who lived past the age of 100 wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and diahann carroll respectively they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill hearth played by amy madigan a white new york times reporter the flashback and presentday scenes dont have as much inspirational value in them as in the book but really are powerful however certain aspects of the sisters lives such as the interracial background of their mother and the reasons behind their fathers stern personality are not presented clearly you need to read the book to fully understand these things which is just as well because the books just as great aside from those flaws its wonderfully done and performed especially by dee and carroll and a very powerful and educational movie
