the 1960s tv series bewitched owes its idea from this movie this is the movie that jimmy stewart  kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivatingbr br this was jack lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs the movie has a lot of good things about it hermine gingold is very good in this movie almost as good in support here as she was in the music man the cast is very solidbr br this movie has a late 1950s new york city feel  a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any  a little magic too bootbr br it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved  sure am glad that william asher saw it so that the 1960s series got created i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen this movie is much better than that
