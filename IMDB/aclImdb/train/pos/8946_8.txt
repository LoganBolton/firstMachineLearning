this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man in a mortal world her community is open among its members but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals hmmmmthis is starting to sound familiar lol its not your typical movie very campy performances by jack lemmon and ernie kovacs keep things from getting dull kim novak is always a pleasure on screen but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual but not fatal to the storybr br with renewed interest in all things witchy and dark this film deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences its still a hoot
