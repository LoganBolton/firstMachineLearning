this prodigal son and eastern condors are my favourite sammo hung films the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in condors but hes no less surefooted as director or actor he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also love and romance are not the directors priorities here but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action and insure that viewers dont hit the fastforward button between the physical clashesbr br the opening scene which features a funny light sabre duel sets a solid but deceptive tone a sequence in which sammos pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp comic tone the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type the films violence escalates slowly until finally when the climactic showdown comes we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production the directoractors assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry menacing opponents is a bonecracking physically punishing delightbr br terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever madebr br great score too
