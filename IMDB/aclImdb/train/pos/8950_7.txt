for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart this is one of his lesser films from later in his career and while it isnt a great film compared to many of his other pictures it isnt bad and is a decent timepasserbut not much morebr br kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her over time the cold and detached ms novak also begins to fall in love with stewartand apparently in the witchs rule book this is a definite no no br br the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches they are neither the babysacrificing nor the allpowerful variety most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps and very oddly the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz considering what i think of jazz it must really stink to be a witch in this movies worldbr br anyway the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic but not something i would rush out to watch the acting is pretty good but the script doesnt offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional filmin fact i almost scored the film a 6it was really close
