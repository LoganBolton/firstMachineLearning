its a gentle easygoing 1950s comedy kim novak belongs to a coven of witches in manhattan she puts a spell on neighbor jimmy stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him losing her powers see witches are permitted to have hot blood but not love elsa lanchester is novaks aunt also a witch jack lemmon is her brother ditto hermione gingold is the chief witch and ernie kovacks is sidney redlich an author who specializes in writing about witchesbr br i described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else everything is so smooth and polished from the set decoration through wardrobe and plot to the performances and direction take the character of ernie kovacks hes referred to as a drunk and a nut and heres how the movie demonstrates these traits he asks for a second drink and though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen his hair is a bit long and tousled thats a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut nothing is out of place everything is tidy and free of dust the soles of jimmy stewarts shoes are barely scuffedbr br and the zodiac club where the witches hang out its called a low dive yet its a clean dark place with polite waiters a quintet of musicians neatly dressed client√®le and potted plants against bare brick walls that is not my idea or yours of a low dive  not even for greenwich village in 1958 my idea of a dive in greenwich village is juliuss or the white horse tavern or the san remo or the swing rendezvous a now defunct lesbian hangout the zodiac club is a high dive compared to thesebr br the kookiness we always hear about is muted by todays standards i mean kim novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet and she wears a lot of black clothes like the beatniks of the period didbr br but never mind all that its an enjoyable romantic comedy kim novak is effective as gillian who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden she has a strange beauty bulky and ethereal at the same time she glides rather than walks a wispy presence her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic french curves and jimmy stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim in the 1930s he usually played in light roles in the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use who could resist laughing when hermione gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of novaks spell its good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming richard quine directs the movie quietly without fireworks or special effects and does some interesting things that the play couldnt have had note the scene in which novak casts the spell over stewart when the siamese cats face and ears seem to merge with novaks startling eyesbr br ernie kovacks in the 1950s was a wellknown television personality there was never anything quite like the ernie kovacks show before  or after it brings the word surrealism to mind he could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only bartoks concerto for orchestra as background and he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of percy dovetail an effete poet the credits kind of skip over the condoli brothers but thats rather casual because these two guys  pete and conte  were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles conte was later a member of doc severisons band on johnny carsons late showbr br the third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more romantic than comedy but its never dull the whole film rolls along as neatly as van drutens play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too
