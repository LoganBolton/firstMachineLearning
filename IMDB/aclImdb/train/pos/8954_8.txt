john van drutens bell book and candle is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modernday witches living in new york city it was obviously an attractive movie property it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd for her erstwhile book publisher enforcedsweetheart shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle including sheps bewildered fiancée the hateful merle kittredge against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spellcasting it even had pyewacket a siamese catfamiliar with welltimed miaows sidney redlitch a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners in short it seemed to its producer perhaps boxoffice magic and so it proved to be so many things were right about its production it only had one element not perfect but i found the rest to be amusing charming and very consistentlyentertaining to begin with the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new yorks scene the technical production was beautiful with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe a fine score by george duning morethanclever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell howard mcnear janice rule as merle ernie kovacs as redlitch jack lemmon as gillias mischievous brother wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment he did well with the comedic portions of his part but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher and a bit tooold for the part of henderson anyhow but director richard quine used subtle lighting pace changes and unusuallycomposed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation the plots main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson who does not believe in witches at all she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée her stuckup college rival later when henderson tries to walk out he keeps coming back to herand realizes he is under a spell as she has apologetically tried to explain to him meanwhile sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson of course he knows nothing at all of magic but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all but gillians brother enlightens him all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powerswhich is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal of course he never really wanted to resist her anyhow the film has sprightly dialogue charm and a little magic of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself and to win the man she loves a lovely ending to this beautifullyphotographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism though a fantasy just about complete in my view memorably delightful
