bell book and candle was shown recently on cable not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy based on the james van drutens broadway hit which was a vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash the film was directed by richard quine who turned the play into a delightful comedybr br evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on vertigo released the same year movie audiences didnt think anything about the age difference when this film was released in fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger womenbr br the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers kim novak was at the height of her beauty as its clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing as the witch that becomes human her gillian is charming james stewart who plays the publisher shep henderson is also seen at his best mr stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the topbr br in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester playing queenie is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here jack lemmons nicky holroyd the brother of gillian is also good ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitchbr br this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching bell book and candle
