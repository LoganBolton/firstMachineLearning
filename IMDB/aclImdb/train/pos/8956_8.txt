i watched this movie after watching practical magic and the older film was far superior i liked the way the lighting makeup and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story jimmy stewarts mannerisms didnt do a lot for me in this film but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillians character i was also struck by nickys and gillians mannerismsit was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine the gestures nicky makes when hes showing redlich his powers especially struck me ive never thought of warlocks as being effeminate so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters
