by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcocks haunting masterpiece vertigo they also made this light comedy perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film  at any rate this a great companion piece to vertigo as it again explores a very unlikely but powerful romance in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of vertigo with its happy ending here again novak undergoes a transformation in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she transforms from witch to mortal stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her unlike vertigo the two come together in bell book and candle  a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein the cast is terrific lemmon hilarious as novaks warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novaks competitor are all great the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at its best anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you havent should see this memorable light comedy
