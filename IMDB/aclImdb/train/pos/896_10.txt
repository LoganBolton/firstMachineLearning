once in a while you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained vivah is just that  maybe more after watching ddlj saajan and lamhey i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that  ever boy was i wrong i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new don just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh  although the decision is already made in my mind after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i dont have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor boy  was i wrong about this movie this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept of arranged marriage but also that he did it with a conviction that it is the right thing to do i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever it was still very very good the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor after company and salman found his groove after hum aapkey hain kaun this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj even though he is shown to be an indian in england  both countries not big on basketball by the way he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values amrita rao for the first time came across as someone to be remembered in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one i think this movie will and should do wonders for her move over rani  there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence oh having almost 0 body fat does not hurt either yes people i will challenge you find even 01 fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too i thought i will never be enamored by anyones beauty after madhuri and early kajol but she completely changed that shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered hum aapkey hain kaun when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again right away yes right away i have never ever done that not even with ddlj but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with i miss those times where families sat down and had fun when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down dont we all want it to happen the families thee tradition the love and respect this is what this movie will remind all of us of i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them
