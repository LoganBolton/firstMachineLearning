generally i am not a huge fan of stopmotion films and at first ruka didnt capture my attention however knowing that this film was made in the repressive czechoslovakia during the sovietdomination era the more i watched the film the more i realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statementbr br the sad little film is done without any dialog but its pretty clear what is happening a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the potmaking it into a sculpture of a hand instead well the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing however over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man and by the end the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand in a sign of real hypocrisy gives the man a heros funeral br br as i said this film is an obvious attempt by the brave jir√≠ trnka to criticize his domineering government not surprisingly though czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise the state ie the hand banned this little parable sadly trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the cocalled velvet revolution
