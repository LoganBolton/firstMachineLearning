i loved this film at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down if youre easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here and some real tossers technically i liked it a lot too they must have used a new deinterlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i wasnt annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers open water drove me nuts mostly because there are cheap progressive cameras available now and i see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema sorry thats my own little rant i definitely recommend this film if youve ever been involved with the music scene it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but its a classic piece
