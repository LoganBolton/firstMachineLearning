damn was that a lot to take in i was pretty much mesmerised throughout it was pretty perfect though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that i cant believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them anton especially to get all of this footage without any serious beef the dandys did come off welltogether middleclass kids who took advantage of their situation and rightly so i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton which maybe wasnt what a lot of other people felt great piece of filmmaking and great choice of subjects i recommend this to any musicfilm fan youll probably learn something about filmmaking
