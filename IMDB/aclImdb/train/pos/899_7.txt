i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goingson the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie the dialogues are much better than those in the umrao jaan ada  a supposedly dialogue based movie the background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie it somehow remind me of vv chopras kareeb in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any departmentlooks or acting the supporting cast are too good i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie however though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana i missed ram laxman badlybr br it had no double entendressivan category no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if youre already or going to be soon engaged i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic the movie is only about prem  poonam rest of the characters are incidental art immitating life the peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair br br coming back everything was almost great except for the drama part the situation of tragedy was artificially created the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all that is why it lacks the emotional punchthe very purpose of this turn of events but a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful premarital video to a feature film but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard may be this will help the movie a taxfree status but the plot could have been made more interesting and nonlinear than what it wasbr br there were too question in my mind when the movie ended 1 has the movie really ended 2 has the movie ended
