at the start this one is from england so of course i had 98  chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema i never heard of this film before from the minute i saw helena bonhamcarter i said to myself  oh heres comes the feminine version of my left foot i was right but i was also wrong wrong because the two movies are very differents my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie not because this is funny but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel daylewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality here very beautiful bonhamcarter did exactly the same thing but with very feminine emotions the story is well written and its very intelligent for me miss bonhamcarter gives one of the greatest womans part of the 1990s with emily lloyd in breaking the waves gee and look at her eyes she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston louise brooks michele morgan and ava gardner shes also a true talent as seen on many other movies see this one you wont regret it and a very fine job by branagh too
