despite its lowkey release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries the r rating in the states cant have helped  honestly just because hbc uses the cword this is actually a fine piece of work the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but its overcome by the playing of the two leadsbr br its easy to win plaudits just because youre playing a physical or mental cripple daniel daylewis geoffrey rush dustin hoffman etc and helena bonhamcarter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely in fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes and what eyes this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performancebr br branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film except possibly hamlet and there his playing was diluted by the large cast here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a selfloathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasnt always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth in short we believe him just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein as the priest in the proposition as the lawyer in the gingerbread man even as andrew in peters friends this is surely his finest performance yet  so why could he not produce the goods much earlierbr br as a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldnt amount to very much but its been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and i eagerly await more from them though not loves labours lost 8 out of 10 but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10
