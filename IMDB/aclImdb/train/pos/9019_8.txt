not wishing to give anything away here i would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a halfs entertainment it will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clich√©d or predictable in any way most definitely recommendedbr br a previous users comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonhamcarters outstanding performances  i agree entirely
