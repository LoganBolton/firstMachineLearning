well vivah is quite a good but typical sooraj barjatyas movie it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc the movie is more than good but not extremely goodbr br the big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and amritas acting especially the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being disliked by her stepmother story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a blockbusterbr br minus point is common story of bollywood movie overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and ofcourse love
