myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of tenko and agree this is by far one of the bbc better seriesthe whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without itno doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of watchingexcellent viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the castingfirst rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult materialso grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video
