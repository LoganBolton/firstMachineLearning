i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad actingin this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some decencyalthough some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you dont get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout lifei think it was an amazing moviekids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be indias sure profoundnessuntil all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it
