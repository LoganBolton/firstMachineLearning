this film caught me by surprise my friend told me that this movie was a chick flick boy was he wrong this movie has a great family appeal with no sex scenes like other movies jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickams shoes the supporting cast is great as wellbr br science comingofage family quarrels a great train scene this film has it all the soundtrack is good although the score is presented quite choppily the 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatnessbr br the dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal replay value is great  ive seen it quite a few times already
