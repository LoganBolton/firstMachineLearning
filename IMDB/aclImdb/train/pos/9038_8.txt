i loved october sky the thing i loved most had to be the music it worked two ways in the first hour of the film it gives the viewer a timeframe this is done by playing songs from the late fifties in the second hour an instrumental score takes over the music now fits the mood of the film perfectlybr br i did not only enjoy the music i also quite enjoyed the cast jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a surprise for me he gave off a firstclass performance as did chris owen quentin and chris cooper john hickambr br ive seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself
