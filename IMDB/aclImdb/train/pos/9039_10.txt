i grew up in southern west virginia im about the same age as or maybe a year older than homer hickam author of the rocket boys the book forming the truestory basis of this heartwarming filmbr br and so i relate closely to the west virginia coalmining theme and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time october 4 1957 on all of us the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the science gap the ussr had on the us in those cold war daysbr br this is a wonderful film for everyone of all ages but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950s itll touch the core of your beingbr br everyone get it watch it recommend it to your friends wholl thank you many times
