i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies this one however was nothing less then goodbr br october sky tells the true story of homer hickam a boy inspired by the sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist he and his friends begin to build rockets his father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coalminer as himself or go to college on a footballscholarship like his brotherbr br the story is well written a bit too predictable maybe but thats ok cause it doesnt focus too much on those parts of the story its important part but where this is obvious the inner action the action between the characters is focused on the story is good it has some clichés but thats ok its based on actual events so you kind of cant just drop out these clichés the characters are really good where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them they are well written and believablebr br this is a good looking movie the sets and the 50s style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit this all sets the mood of the film very goodbr br the acting is really good jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam as for the rest of the cast they are good too all together this makes out a pretty strong castbr br all in all im glad i caught this movie it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events if i had known that when seeing it it would probably just be even more interesting october sky is a good and interesting movie its a movie i believe everyone can enjoy its kind of a feelgood movie not bad at all
