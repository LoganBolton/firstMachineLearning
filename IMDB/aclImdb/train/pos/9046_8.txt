i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead 2005 a little while back and since then ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles hell crack an oscar one daybr br thats not to denigrate this film at allbr br its a fine story with very believable people well its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast  chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitementand the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tappingbr br but this film had a very special significance for me in 1957 i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it wasbr br i didnt achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but thats what you find out when you see this moviebr br sure its a basic family movie but thats a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs
