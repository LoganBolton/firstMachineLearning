this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from todays more hectic and loud films it is another solid basedonatrue store which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes frankly i dont know but i liked the storybr br the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else including his father does in this west virginia town the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which i think was overdone i would like to have a little less tension between the twobr br the young man still a boy is played by jake gyllenhaal one of his first staring assignments i think hes likable as are his school buddies in here its nice to see nice kids in a modernday film the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper the dad and laura dern the kids teacher who encourages him all the timebr br the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear once again i wish there more of these kind of films made today
