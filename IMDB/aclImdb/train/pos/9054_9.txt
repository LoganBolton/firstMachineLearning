october sky is a film that will steal your heart fill your mind with vivid imagery and lift your spirit the tale of homer hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first especially when the film is set in a mining town where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine but homer cannot follow in his fathers footsteps with the encouragement of miss rileya friendly teacher members of his fathers staff and his friends homer attempts to make his dream a realitybr br yet as in any true to life story there are many stops along the way director joe johnston lowers us into the coal mines where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock with lit helmets and bent posture they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness the hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their workbr br contrasting the mine shafts lugubrious load are the images of homer and his friends rocket launches underneath the blue bowl of sky rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphereand nothing can match the scene when homer sees sputnik for the first timebr br yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters homers father is a classic hardened manbut he has a soft side as well we see that he does love his son despite their many arguments the love and support of miss riley is evident as well best of all the film is uncomfortable it doesnt tie everything up in a nice bow it tears at you lifts you up it keeps an air of reality which is important in a film like thisbr br this film can be considered a complete work at first i was disappointed that the film did not continue with homers life i didnt want it to end then i realizedthats what a good film does to a person if it has done its job you wont want it to end and october sky accomplishes just that
