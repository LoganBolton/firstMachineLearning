so we compromised this was a fairly charming film i liked the art direction it felt far more real than most kids movies and the costumes werent too cutesy the child actors were not bad to watch the adult performances trended toward cheesy it was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullyingbr br i dont know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves but its a great film to take a kid to and since barnyard was apparently attended by 100 kids at the same time im really glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of worms instead
