this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary schoolbr br this is about a new kid in town named billy he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully winsbr br the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie the kid actors over exaggerate on many things they think its apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job thoughbr br the plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation i was able to watch this movie without looking at the timesometimesbr br overall this was a good family movie with some weak points i rate this movie 710
