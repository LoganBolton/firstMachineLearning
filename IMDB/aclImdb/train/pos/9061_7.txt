i really liked the movie i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the bookbr br i was kidsitting for a boy and a girl ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie but happily at the end she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came outbr br there were some great laughoutloud moments and the movie was not as gross as i expected it would be  tho it did rank pretty high up there on the grossometer br br the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the dilly line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part  that to me was the only shocker moment and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie  i have no clue why that was put in the movie it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shockgasp factor  other than that a pretty good movie nice to see the pepsi girl all grown up
