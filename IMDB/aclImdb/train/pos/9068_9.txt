i thought the kids in the movie were great i deal with kids in that age group and i thought their behaviors were very believable i did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5year old i didnt think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie br br i think luke benward is up and coming star i would like to see more of him on the big screen i enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences almost all of the actors did this throughout the moviebr br i also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group it is a major problem in schools todaybr br the ending was quite unexpected billys thoughts on whether he won or didnt win the bet were very surprising how he handled that situation was excellent too often today kids are not willing to compromise the actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life
