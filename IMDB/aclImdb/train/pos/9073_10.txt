my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenbergs refrain boys are so weird its refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it its clean and delightfully acted by a preadolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic freaks and geeks we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the freaks  geeks which didnt survive its first season but soldout its dvd release do see it especially if you have boys and youll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say boys are so weird dont miss it
