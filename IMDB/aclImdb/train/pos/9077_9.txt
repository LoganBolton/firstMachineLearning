i really enjoyed the pilot it was as amazing as i hoped it would be if not better patrick warburton was a riot although at first i thought that i wouldnt be able to stand his character him and megyn price had little chemistry at all but hopefully as the season goes on theyll get more comfortable around each other it must have been weird for megyn to go from being the star on her last show grounded for life to being a costar br br bianca kajlich and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene but i think in time theyll get better david spades character to my surprise wasnt the whole focus of this pilot the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else ive ever seen on tv but i think that it is just his style it works for himbr br i think that couples or even singles will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions that this show is about all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life not sugarcoated like most showsbr br i hope for all the actors sakes that cbs gives them a chance this show has the potential to be one of the best series if just given the chance and time
