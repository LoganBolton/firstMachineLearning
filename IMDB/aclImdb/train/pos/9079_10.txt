this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship as a man married for 26 years i empathize with patrick warburtons character he loves his wife but he assumes she knows that i also enjoy his monotone delivery never gets too excited or too low a nice ensemble of characters this will be a nice addition to the monday night lineupbr br i dont know how david spade will be in his role he is best enjoyed in small doses he also seems a little old to still be trolling for womenbr br i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops
