i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the koreans oh and its from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies i liked host but not my absolute favorite some of my favorite scifi fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste mirrormask stardust serenity gattaca willow matrix resident evil series lotr stargate dark citybr br it wasnt confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great there are some holes in the story but didnt really matter i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters the korean legend was interesting the reincarnation stuff was different and i thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like korean actors in other shows ethansbehrhair looked so asianbr br yes it could be better and i hope in the future that korea with its unusual quirky sense of life intense emotions and unexpected humor can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future
