yes some people have said that this movie was a waste of money but im the kind of die hard dragonworldendingholy crap action movie fanbr br but if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good but its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised mebr br the 3d graphics were pretty damn good i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had the fight between good and evil at the end was i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better it was still pretty goodbr br now on to the parts that i think could have been better the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles i mean if you dont really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a dvderbr br overall i loved the moviebut the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well
