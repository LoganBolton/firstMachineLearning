if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated youll enjoy dwar if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films youll enjoy dwar otherwise dont bother i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends they really loved it and that made me feel good after the movie was over all the kidsmy nephews and their friendscould not stop thanking me for taking them to the theaterbr br the cg is good acting and directing are horrible storyline is extremely simple but since the half of the audience was kids they were screaming shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have beenbr br its a good movie to take your kids to but except for the final battle sequence dwar is disappointing i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much
