saxophonist ronnie bowers dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at hollywwod hotel of course at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall lola lane has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia rosemary lane to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him its not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourselfbr br the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good highlighted by hooray for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drivein musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesiebr br still the movie isnt that good the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy also there is racisma stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and theres some truly appalling racist humor at one point thats probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting todaybr br all in all a soso movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7
