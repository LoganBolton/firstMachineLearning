domestic import was a great movie i laughed the whole time it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations the acting was great alla korot larry dorf howard hesseman and all the others did an awesome job because it is an independent film written by a firsttime writer it doesnt have the clich√©s that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heartwarming story i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious and amazing i highly recommend this movie
