spanish films are into a if not golden definitely a silver age pi√©dras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or deathlevel they still arent really melodramatic this could happenbr br there are different stories here which become connected one is about the retarded girl who doesnt dare to pass the street to the next block one is about the middleaged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist another is about the girl with drug problems whos lover leaves her still another one is about the madame of a brothel who almost finds true lovebr br definitely worth seeing its in spain the moviemakers take women seriously
