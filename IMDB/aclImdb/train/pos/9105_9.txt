women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in salazars film piedras although editors cut here and there might help the film it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from pedro almodovars latest films 5 different women are coping with their male partners and families beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on salazar portraits his women characters in the same neurotic and borderline behaviour familiar to almodovar a kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish to smaller shoes a burlesque house madam taking care of her disabled daughter a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxidriver taking care of her late husbands disturbed kids all roaming the streets of madrid in well designed scenes using some of almodovars familiar actresses the director succeeds in its first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film and to create genuine sympathy with each of them the women controls the plot line and the men are bound to be left with each other eventually surprisingly good for a first film and worth the time in any standard it is noticeable that salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen especially by monica cervera which played in his former short filmbr br a must to all almodovars fans and enjoyable to all
