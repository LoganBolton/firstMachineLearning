since i watched it for the first time piedras is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women all of them somehow interconnected with deep understanding and sensibility ramón salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut and proves himself as an efficient actors director br br not that all performances are excellent though of all leading ladies they range from average najwa nimri to very good vicky peña but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer mónica cervera who convincingly plays antonia san juans retarded daughter enrique alcides is irresistibly charming as the girls male nurse and there are nice small turns from andrés gertrúdix geli albaladejo and the director himself ramón salazarbr br piedras is beautifully written and filmed when i watched it i got so moved that i couldnt stop thinking of it for days i highly recommend it
