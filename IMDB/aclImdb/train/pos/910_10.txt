it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best ata story woven around a marriageit feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family though the story is simple and does not contain any new elementsyou still like the moviebecause of the presentation performancesand actually the over all treatment hats off to suraj the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love the depiction of the changes in the way of thinkingbehaving once you get engaged is excellent director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfectionthough the movie is slowyou dont mind itbecause you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tearsspecially ladies but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth
