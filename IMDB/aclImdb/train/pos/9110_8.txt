you know our spirit is based on that revolution its asleep i can explain i think well until that happen on 25th april 1974 our freedom was limited we didnt had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion we dont use our liberty of speech thats all a consequence of the revolution i think thats clear about the movie i think that it has a few mistakes on some characters acting but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies its quite good i like it very much
