being halfportuguese doesnt render me halfblind nor halfprejudiced when discussing portuguese films not that i get to do that very often anyway but this film was such a rush of adrenaline yes thats right  it was mostly accurate as far as history wentgoes  but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguesefilm territory things like using real locations in the middle of trafficcongested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago and by god did they get it right ok to sum it up very emotional if youve lived through it but youll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were if youre just watching it randomly youre in for a good historical romp only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thoughtproving than usual even by european standards yes
