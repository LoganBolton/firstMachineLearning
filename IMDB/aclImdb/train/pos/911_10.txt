vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable however i have watched this movie three times nowand believe me its an awesome moviebr br vivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do or would do when it comes to marriage in that sense sooraj r barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a wellmade highly entertaining moviebr br several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately br br  when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride amrita rao  the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family the song do anjaane ajnabi goes well with the mood of this scenebr br  the first conversation between shahid and amrita when he comes to see her  ie a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation also amritas naive nature limited eyecontact shy characteristics and answering softly to shahids questionsbr br  the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle alok nath when she feeds him at shahids party in the form of anothers daughterinlaw rather than her uncles beloved niecebr br clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectlybr br shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r barjatya film in fact shahid and amrita make a cute onscreen couple without a shadow of doubt other characters  alok nath excellent anupam kher brilliant mohan joshi very goodbr br on the whole vivah delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families the movie has topnotch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r barjatya its a must see
