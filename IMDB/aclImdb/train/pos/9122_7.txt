purple rain is a great film if you are a 40something music lover who partied to prince music in the 1980s the story is a muchused formula rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and selfrespect prince is a bad actor but his performance especially of purple raini would die 4 u make it worth sitting through the film he is himself and as a showman as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson circa thriller apollonia kotero a former prince protégé is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince but her script doesnt let her far morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements
