this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors didnt have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their filmbr br firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita it is definitely the making of the filmbr br i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy in response to this i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk hahk hssh and mpkdh it has been toned down significantly hssh was almost unbearable to watch in some placesbr br in this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to thembr br another major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita both have acted very well especially shahid who looks great in the film amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major starbr br although i really enjoyed the film as a whole i do feel that it was too long some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact i also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more uptodate soundtrack had been available although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderfulbr br all in all i definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax i wont go into details just in case you havent seen itbr br ps if youre prone to cryingtake a tissue i needed several
