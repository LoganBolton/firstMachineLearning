purple rain has never been a critics darling but it is a cult classic  and deserves to be if you are a prince fan this is for youbr br the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl believe it or not this movie isnt just singing and dancing there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works very hit and missbr br no one can really act in the film everyone is from one of princes side acts like the time and vanity 6 still it adds charm to the movie when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak br br in conclusion go and see this if you love prince like me if you arent a fan itll make you one
