i dont care how many bad reviews purple rain gets this movie rocks excellent movie has it all great musicprince of coarse romance and dramabr br this is really a very sad movie very moving i dont want to say to much more im not into giving away the plot but i will say thisthe film is very realistic there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film i see this as being very realistic and being so real makes the movie that much more moving my generation loved this movie growing up so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problemsbr br that said its definetly not just a movie for teens id recomend it to all age groups and its not all so dark the movie has some great music band performance scenes and sexy fun scenes between prince and appelonia
