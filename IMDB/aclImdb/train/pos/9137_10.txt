this is the only movie ive seen prince in but it dont matter and i thought he was only great at singing boy was i wrong this is probably his best performance the music is great thats why it won the oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie or something like that now he has an oscar and grammies under his belt although the cursing gets in the way with the film just make sure no little kids or in the room there isnt to much to say without revealing the plot you should really go out and get this movie your collection isnt complete unless you got this movie in it what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now
