you can debate princes acting talent or even his choice to parody his own life in this film there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now he seems like a shadowy hasbeen twenty years later but the music remains relevant and fantastic br br having lived through the hype of this movie graduated high school in85 i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time from tipper gore als wife trying to censor little nikki and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc parents music resource center to every air band at the time impersonating prince it was the absolute hottest thing out for a few weeks at least prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson br br we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered it didnt disappoint everyone was caught up i was an mtv junkie at the timethey actually played music thenall the timeprince played at least once or twice an hour i must qualify this commentary by saying that at that time my favorites were billy idol oingo boingo the fixx flock of seagulls and others in the punk new wave genre the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then all the things that remind you of the 80s were iconic then it was mainstream and it seems like a clich√© now it got so popular that it became ridiculous its like the rappin granny commercial for wendys hamburgers br br it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it sadly kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something anyway i hope this gave you all a little insight
