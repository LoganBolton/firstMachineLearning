ok so it may not be the awardwinning movie of the year typefilm apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards but it is a really great film about the kid prince  o take your pick and the happenings around him living in minneapolis playing his music the music is absolutely superb in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays out a nice plot its worth seeing over and over again espeically if you like prince  o which i do of course
