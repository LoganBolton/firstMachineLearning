as a bigtime prince fan of the last three to four years i really cant believe ive only just got round to watching purple rain the brand new 2disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it wow i was really looking forward to watching it but i wasnt prepared for just how electric it actually is princes musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding  he really has the moves in this one i am very familiar from repeated listens with the classic purple rain album and all its songs but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics  like computer blue the beautiful ones when doves cry and purple rain itself there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform the closing songs baby im a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid20s hes overflowing it blew me away it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak yearsbr br prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams  drive her to a lake make her jump in then drive off  absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsightbr br some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the films overall charm morris day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style  i love their dancing in this bit and how benton provides morris with a mirror midperformancebr br i already cant wait to watch it again i really cant extras are terrific  particularly seeing a young eddie murphy prebeverly hills cop admit he is a prince groupie
