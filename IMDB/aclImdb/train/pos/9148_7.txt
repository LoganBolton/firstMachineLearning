a much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an everdeclining spiral of domestic violencebr br at times difficult to watch while morris day is portrayed as the misogynist prince as the knight on motorcycle steed he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and wendy  lisa even further two of his compositions  computer blue admittedly the albums weakest track and darling nikki  are shown as being songs that kill off an audience perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a card that lists the slightly shorter than prince apollonia as 56br br the nearly completeamateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that theyve never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point and do perfectly well under the direction morris day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham though jerome benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well particularly their stage act which is hilarious day and benton even go so far as to make an abbott and costello routine funny which takes some doingbr br lastly theres prince while i admit to bias i do actually think hes a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a lowkey version of himself acting isnt his profession this was a film made for entertainment so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isnt robert deniro and thinking theyre making a point is sadly deluded i dont want this review to be a derisory attack of other peoples comments but ive even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit how would a film about domestic violence be shot then with full overhead spotlights and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame br br the film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie eraÂ… until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths and this isnt some retrorecreation princes best film with oscarwinning music it sees him at his zenith and its saddening to realise that even though he would make some fine albums he would never again capture this high
