vivah is by no means a classic however in the days of hardcore action pathbreaking special effects  complex plots none of which bollywood has mastered yet its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah the story as we all know is a journey from a couples first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times nothing more nothing less the music isnt quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesnt jar your senses either two songs stood out for me  mujhe haq hai  do anjaane while milan abhi aadha  hamaari shaadi were hummable shahid performs sincerely  shows a lot of potential its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile smalltown girl to perfection alok nath anupam kher  seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job surajs direction is simple but effective the movies prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers but all in all a good clean decent family movie
