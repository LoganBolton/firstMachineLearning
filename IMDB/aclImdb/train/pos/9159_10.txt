playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors whove besieged the castle before fortunately for the fantasists this version  with the nicely cast zelah clarke and timothy dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it its the right length to do the story full justice and makes considerable use of brontes cracking dialogue none of that modern meddling away cutting text and adding new and inferior scenesbr br the magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters and the lives circumstances create for them to lead jane  poor plain and little  grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school she arrives as a governess in the household of mr rochester utterly friendless and alone she represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience but her passionate nature soon finds its touchpaper in her stern keenly intelligent enigmatic master to whom she is drawn as he is to her by forces beyond their control rochester is the caged tiger busy paving hell with energy potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him  but pervious through a chink or two his character is extraordinary he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate but then jane is no ordinary employee as he sees but a dark secret and severe trials lie before them bothbr br its a pleasure to hear brontes remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors  dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a brontean scale if youve only ever seen him as a notsomemorable bond youve missed the thing hes best at those whove commented that his rochester is too handsome miss the point of these dramatisations his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewers attention timothy dalton is just right not always or consistently handsome but often glancingly strikingly so just as it should be and zelah clarkes jane is no wallflower she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effectbr br not so long ago the bbc aired an excellent dramatisation of jean rhys enlightened and most unsettling riposte to bronte wide sargasso sea imagining the backstory of the first mrs rochester do check it out  youll never see the hero of jane eyre in quite the same way again
