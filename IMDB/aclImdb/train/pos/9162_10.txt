though i did not begin to read the classics in literature until i was 47 its never too late jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isnt a part of the book i liked less only parts i enjoyed more the 1983 tv miniseries with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be i saw it as a full length movie in 2006 daltons mr rochester was very good but i absolutely loved zelahs jane eyre relecting on another classics movie i saw recently i was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism using the title after such license is fraud leave it to the brits to get this one right among others you wont be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with its proper context and spirit well done bbc
