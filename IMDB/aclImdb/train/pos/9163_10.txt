when my now college age daughter was in preschool this miniseries appeared on ae from 89 each morning my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldnt miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week good choicebr br id forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently timothy dalton is very handsome but still perfect as rochester the dark craggy face the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book although dalton eats a little scenery i couldnt sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romancebr br i would love to know whats become of zelah clarke she is dead on as jane quiet formal saying volumes with but a look the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth criticism of her performance as wooden is misplaced a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion unlike many other screen janes she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochesters attraction to herbr br brontes dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard she refuses to be cowed by the dark blustery rochester the two leads play off each other beautifully br br this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever
