if a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed you need not look for it you will find all and more in this nearperfect presentation of charlotte brontës masterpiecebr br rarely have i seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based but i admit to that here although i have not read jane eyre i am convinced that i have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion i only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within mebr br i need not divulge anything in the way of plot here let me just say this if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is jane eyre i implore you to doubt no more every atom of might and magic that has reared jane eyre as a popular classic of english literature has successfully been captured in this filmbr br what brontë did not bring herself clarke and dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity the movies success is no doubt due in no small part to their acting prowessbr br love jane eyre or hate her but appreciate the richness the vitality the truth of the story love the characters love the actors all just as you would love what is great in cinema
