this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990s versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980s period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbeybr br the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90s versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it
