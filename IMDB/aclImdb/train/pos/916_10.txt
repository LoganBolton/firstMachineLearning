my comments for vivah  its a charming idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegrooms families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is naively visualized but the sneakedin romantic moments between the tobemarried couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressingbr br v i v a h  showcases a lot of good things  beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the abouttobecouple waiting to get married  playing by the rules  simple yet beautiful such a simple story  no plot  no villain  as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film  which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage  the union of 2 families i think amrita rao  looks very good  she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes  although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur  who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti ie amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahids bro  sisinlaw it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk  hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid  amrita is awesomebr br stuff like sanctity in a marriagerelationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care  space waiting for getting married officially prayingsacrficing for ur beloved  all these and more get showcased in vivah theres still some good audience who r going  enjoying this film some of the folksaudience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arrangedmarriage  thats success if you ask me it seems amrita rao  our actressfromvivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006  hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah  shahid or amrita didnt get any of the filmfare  other awards  least this is news to cheer about  congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bridetobe in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way  shudnt forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today  imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar  its no mean achievement  congrats to amrita rao  for taking her career to another level with this award  i personally feel  she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur  they make a cute couple and their onscreen chemistry reminds me of srkkajol or aamir khan  juhi chawla  br br some points that i observedfew of the elements  1 if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence  in this film  perfect fit 2 shahid kapur is like most of us  not exactly ready for marriage or earlymarriage  but prem listens carefully to the stepwise talk given by his dad  having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty  trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling  that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible  3 in the entire movie  there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid  amrita are together  or shown to be together its unlike most other romanticweddingbased movies where hero  heroine are always singingdancing or nowadays  doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences  characterized by restraint innocence  respect for the other  4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath  amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughtersgirlkids in some parts of india 5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely  no cheap scenessongs are beautifully pictured  words like jalpraarthana etc are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film  personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 last but not the least  the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life  is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the loveicantdowithoutu  its a hatsoff feeling  br br  in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam  for the freshnessonscreenchemistry of the lead pair    if u ask me  along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact  i think vivah does deserve better viewingbusiness than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those timepassfuzzystylecrap movies
