spoiler alert i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points but i cant sorrybr br i was looking for an imdb review of the george c scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though awhile truncated and rushed i thought george c scott embodied the tortured nature and physical appearance of the books rochester to a t and beven while looking at the dvds cover i was thinking isnt timothy dalton too goodlooking for the role the latter concern was reinforced by the fact that i decided to reread the book while the dvd was on backorder that said the minute i started watching this i was captivated at first it was disconcerting to hear 1840s dialog spoken as writtenwith little or no attempts at modernizationbut dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly that i actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus i know someone who wont watch any versions of jane eyre because who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic frankly if someone who hadnt read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions they would think thats pretty much all the story entailsrochesters secret and its affect on everyone around him luckily this version is actually about jane eyres whole lifebr br some people have criticized the casting dalton is too dashing clarke is too reserved i cant argue against the first point but he is so in the moment that i believe he is rochester to me clarkes performance is on the mark jane eyre is quiet guarded if one remembers the book so much of the adult janes fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles some of the criticisms baffle me reviewers say clarke is too short or isnt pretty enough the book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain jane is ms clarke shouldnt be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make janes declarations of her lack of beauty credible she can scarcely help it if dalton is tall some say there is no chemistry between the leads what the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regretand thats just the first example that comes to mindbr br i do agree with some of the other criticisms i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings some of the dialog was oddly truncated when rochester declares jane you misjudge me i do not hate her because she is mad i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad he would still love and care for her its a powerful moment in the book and i wish it had been included i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own it might have been done for claritys sake but i found it jarring i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane opines that rochesters ardor will cool and hell become gruff again but he may like her again by and by daltons performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaringwhen rochester weeps in the library i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene not as rochester as for the sets if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960s show dark shadows one knows what to expectvery stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the makeup job rochester sports at the end yikes it is bad the conclusion is too abrupt after all that anguish and suspense i wanted a more rounded off ending and on my copy of the dvd having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 2530 minute episodes gets to be a bit much that said i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again
