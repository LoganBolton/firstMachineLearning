there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now its just a classic and offers much more of the story than others do timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester rarely missing the mark his performance is astonishingly nimble and manycolored while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character zelah clarkes jane is more cerebral than otherworldly but she makes a perfect foil for dalton who appropriately towers over her the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing once youve absorbed the shock of daltons charisma there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better though this pretty much was a topoftheline production by the bbcs standards of that time but its the performances that are the real pleasure dont miss this one
