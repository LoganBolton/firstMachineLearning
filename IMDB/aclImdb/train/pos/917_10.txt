i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme found it touching and sensitive it is not for someone with a realitymind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes dont make sense william russ did a grand job as hank i have only seen him in the remake of the long hot summer where he played a weak character but in this one the expression in his eyes throughout as hank considered the things that were happening to him was wonderful and tender valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role and peter falk as max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes there were many special scenes including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life its not for everyoneespecially those who arent into feelgood movies and this is definitely one if you like everything to be perfect and make sense avoid this one but i think it is wellworth rewatching which is why i taped it yes some of us still have vcrs
