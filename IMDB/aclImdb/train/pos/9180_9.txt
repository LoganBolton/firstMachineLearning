i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 timothy dalton  zelah clarke adaptation of jane eyre because id just written an article about the 2006 bbc jane eyre for thescreamonlinebr br so i approached watching this the way id approach doing homeworkbr br i was irritated at first the lighting in this version is bad everyone  everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the charactersbr br and the sound is poorly recorded i felt like i was listening to a high school playbr br and the pancake makeup is way too heavybr br and the sets dont fully convey the gothic mood of the novel they are too fussy too martha stewart i just cant see brontes rochester abiding such martha stewart domestic arrangements orson welles rochester lived in cavelike gloom very appropriate to the novels gothic moodbr br and yet  with all those objections  not only is this the best jane eyre ive seen it may be the best adaptation of any novel ive ever seenbr br this jane eyre in spite of its technical flaws brought the feeling back to me of reading jane eyre for the first timebr br the critics of this production say it is too close to the book for me someone who valued the book and didnt need it to be any less wordy or any less christian or any more sexed up this versions faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest assetbr br bronte wrote a darn good book theres a reason it has lasted 150 years plus while other slicker sexier and easier texts have disappearedbr br as a long time jane eyre fan i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester rochester is famously not handsome jane and rochester are literatures famous ugly couple and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsomebr br but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester he just blew me away ive never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role the text the dialogue and rochesters love for jane dalton brings the pages rochester to quivering life on screenbr br rochester is meant to be a bit scary dalton is scary welles got the scary streak down too for example when he shouts enough after fontaine plays a short piano piece but dalton is scary more than once here you really cant tell if hes going to hurt jane or himself in his desperationbr br rochesters imperiousness his humor his rage his vulnerability dalton conveys all sometimes seconds apart its stunningbr br and heres the key thing  the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair lonely living with an ugly lifedestroying secretbr br no other actor ive seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does current fan favorite toby stephens doesnt even try dalton hits it out of the park if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar i would say that guy is trouble dont even look at him hes that radioactive with tamped down agonybr br zelah clarke is not only overall the best jane ive seen shes one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane no folks who know jane eyre only from the 2006 version bronte did not describe a statuesque robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips rather charlotte brontes jane is indeed poor plain obscure and little and not prettybr br zelah has a small mouth closeset eyes and a bit of a nose shes truly little she is no fashion model and she is the best jane the truest to the bookbr br some described her a cold or boring no shes true to the book brontes jane is not a red hot mama shes a sheltered deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments as zelahs do here the books jane is someone you have to watch slowly carefully patiently observantly if you want to truly plumb her depths you have to watch zelah here to get to know who she really isbr br i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene but thats one scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very goodbr br in spite of its closeness to the text this version like every other version ive seen shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in jane eyre christianity is not incidental subtext in jane eyre it is centralbr br helen burns instructs jane in christianity thus giving her a subversive counter cultural way to read and live her apparently doomed pinched life it is christianity and a christian god who convinces poor plain obscure jane of her equal worth her need to live up to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal that isnt made fully clear herebr br in any case charlotte bronte wrote an excellent complex rich novel and this adaptation of it of all the ones ive seen mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation ive seen and that says a lotbr br other versions that dont fully honor the book end up being a chore to watch in many places if you dont care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochesterbr br this version like brontes novel realizes that everything bronte wrote  about janes experiences at lowood and her relationship to st john  are part of what makes janes relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is
