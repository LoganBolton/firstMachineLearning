yes this production is long good news for bronte fans and it has a somewhat dated feel but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you wont want to watch any other versionsbr br timothy dalton is edward rochester its that simple i dont care that other reviewers claim hes too handsome dalton is attractive certainly but no prettyboy in fact he possesses a craggy angular dark charm that in my mind is quite in keeping with the mysterious very masculine mr r and he takes on rochesters sad tortured persona so poignantly he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it but also displays rochesters tender passionate emotional side as well imo the newer ae production suffers in that ciaran hinds  whom i normally adore  seems to bluster and bully his way throughout ive read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beastbr br when i reread the novel i always see zelah clarke as jane ms clarke to me resembles jane as she describes herself and is described by others small childlike fairy though its true the actress doesnt look 18 she portrays janes attributes so well while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and passionate nature in check her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen who was the picture of demure submission although her true nature was dissimilar jane learned to master her temper and appear docile in keeping with the schools aims for its charity students who would go into service jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr rochester she would certainly not speak to him as an equal even later on when she gave as well as she got she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer nevertheless if you read the book  to which this production stays amazingly close  you can clearly see the small struggles zelahasjane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and eventemperedbr br the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right i think no it does not in the least resemble hollywood thank god its not a hollywood sort of book but theirs is a romance which is true devoted and loyal and for a woman like jane who never presumed to have any love come her way it is a minor miraclebr br the rest of the casting is terrific and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here so too is much of the rich poetic original dialogue this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely infamous gypsy scene and in general features more humor than other versions ive seen in particular the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightfulbr br jane eyre was in many ways one of the first novelized feminists she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently and at last as rochesters true equal just beautiful
