its too bad a lot of people didnt understand this and the next episodebr br but dont worry ill explain it too you br br this episode is split in 2 partsbr br first part is tonys dream in his coma second part is what happens in real lifebr br now what people didnt understand is that tonys dream is more then just a dream in this episode its about his preparation for his death he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world you will notice what im saying at the doctor scene where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains his life they makers really did a superb job of interpreting theyre own thoughts of what happens when you die br br if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing with great spiritual meaningsbr br like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb br br only thing i didnt understand was what the role where of the monks gonna re watch it till i get thisbr br anyways this episode really touched me and i dont think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experiencebr br 1010 no doubt
