let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on dvd at 10 oclock pm one night i could not fall asleep until about 300 ambr br this brief review may contain spoilersbr br im a longtime fan of the sopranos and i can safely say this is the best episode ive seen im not saying everyone should feel this way but i do this episode is identical to the weekend i spent with my family watching over my own father comatose in the icu before he passedbr br the episode begins with tony in an alternate reality he is a salesman whos identity has been mistaken for that of a man named kevin finnertybr br by the time ten minutes had gone by i knew either tony was dreaming or i was watching some other show it wasnt like the normal sopranos and i loved itbr br option 1 is confirmed when anthony or kevin looks into the sky at a helicopter spotlight and we see prodding through it a doctor with a flashlight we see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one i just statedbr br tony has come out of the coma for only a moment his boys take aj home and carmella overcome by stress breaks down in the hallway a signature moment in the episodebr br for the remainder of the episode we cut in between the real world the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma and tonys alternate reality which parallels whats going on both in his mind and in the real world around himbr br then comes the stellar point in the episode after aj finishes telling his mother hes flunked school she walks in to see meadow sitting at anthonys sidebr br she approaches tony and utters the best line of the episode anthony can you hear us in tonys world he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light he takes off his shoes and goes to the phone he tries to dial but he cannotas if he were trying to say something back to carmella but couldnt physically bring himself to do so not yetbr br he sits down and looks out his window a shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the citybr br when its cold id like to die by moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional rollercoaster of an episodebr br 10 out of 10br br ps watch the next episode you find out what the light is its wonderful
