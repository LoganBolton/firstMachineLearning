okay i didnt get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldnt put my finger on this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno but let me see what hasnt been discussed yetbr br a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator yeah 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons especially religious but heres one more for ya on a hunch i consulted wikipedia and guess what dante divided into 7 levels purgatorio excluding antepurgatory and paradise the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and what tony cant get to br br on to the allegedly random monkslap scene as soon as the monks appeared it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial death disease and sin came on and hes getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him by the time he meets the monks hes thinking hey maybe these guys can help me which sounds like contemplating other religions eg buddhism and wondering if some other path could take him to salvation not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist but it appears finnerty tried that and messed up that slap in the face basically tells tony theres no quick fix as in no you cant suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here br br tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven but at the conference entrance he realizes thats not going to be so easy for him at first i saw the name vs drivers license problem as tony having led sort of a double life what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people he feels free to have an affair with quasimelfi because hes kevin finnerty he figures out that he can fool some people with kfs cards like hotel receptionists but it wont get him out of purgatory those helicopters the helicopters of heaven are keeping track of him and everything he doesbr br after reading all the theories on infinnerty though it seems like kfs identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony couldve taken in his life possibly along with the car joke involving infinitis that made no sense to me otherwise aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out
