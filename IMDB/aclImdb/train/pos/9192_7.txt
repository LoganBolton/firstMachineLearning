lets start this review out on a positive note  i am very glad they didnt decide to wimp out with tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring actually creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite we dont actually know if tony will live or die hes in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none this episode seemed to move very slow and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed asian monks slapping the sht out of him was absolutely flatout weird after 45minutes i got a little sick of everyone grieving but that shouldn t be a reason to slam this episode it was a weird and unpredictable episode but it was still wellwritten and intense edie falco gave an astounding careerdefining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husbands couldbe demise i also found it interesting aj dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against junior which aj most likely wont have the balls to pull off silvio is now actingboss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes there were a lot of great quips in this episode also and i think vito polesmoker spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy sobbr br this wasnt a great episode and disappointed only because even though tony kills people we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show this was a necessary episode for the series even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion kudos to edie falcos performance and david chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist this is the only season of the sopranos where i havent a fcking clue where it is going to go i cant wait for next weeks episode my rating 7510 br br best line of the episode paulie to aj lets go van helsing
