it holds very true to the original manga of the same name aka tramps like us in the us but it can still be enjoyed even if you havent read the manga its a different kind of tail showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else however because of her outward strength she fears showing her inner feelings and thus lets those around her hurt her with their blunt comments the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pethumanmomo if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful jdorama japanese drama actorsresses then this is definitely the series to watchand read
