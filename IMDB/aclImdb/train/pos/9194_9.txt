i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujuns spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on hana yori dango but i liked him much better in thisbr br although the characters are interesting and welldeveloped i was disappointed to find that they didnt change very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didnt really still a fun time had by all even for fukushima
