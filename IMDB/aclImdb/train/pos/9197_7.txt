this is actually a groovyneat little flick made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness  it takes a little while to warm up to it the acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zenlike charm after a few scenes you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries the characters all develop a quirky charm especially richard forget anthony hopkins maidens is the guy id hire to play a raving psychopath he just seems to enjoy it so very much mixed in with the scenes of madslasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character the midnight skater zooming through the campus in a black hoodie looking for all the world like a cross between the grim reaper and say the silver surfer these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the skater seem almost ominous the soundtrack features some very fun garagepunk tunes and the raspy raucous meanness of it meshes well with the films mood thumbs upish i say
