having been a fan of columbo i was sorely disappointed in corky romano while certainly a funny movie falks mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant hes played for so many years especially with the offensive language he used after corky romano i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr peter falk however having just seen finding john christmas and its predecessor a town without christmas for the first time within a week of each other i have to say that max peters falks delightful character in both movies is surely as memorable and lovable as columbo while parts of the movie are quite predictable such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies and i highly recommend them whether youre a falk fan a christmas nut or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feelgood movie of the week this movie may end up lost among the throngs of madefortv holiday flicks so be sure to find finding john christmas before its too late
