ive read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcadelike game with a desire to ripoff the max payne style not just bullettime so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is and how different from max payne yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the gamestyle this game is nonstop action  a mix between a shootem up and a fightem up so much fun as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same but if you want a bit more of that bullettime you should definitely own this game
