this one grew on me i love the rd burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept rewatching the movie the brothersister plot line is powerful i thought theres also more probably obligatory stuff like bar fights a loony crime story etc that are just distracting though not unfunny from a certain point of view also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing itbr br like many of the bollywood movies ive seen this one is melodramatic and operalike including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to reconnect with this girl grown up and troubled she had been told her brother and mother were dead numbing her pain with drugsbr br a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought hordes of seekers to india from an indian point of view that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies but nonetheless in india living only for the pleasures of the moment the hippie singingdancingdrugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone im old enough to remember and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zonedout kids are actual hippie extras as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywoodbr br it is not about the actual hare krishna movement though the movie hippies sing a krishnarama chant as do a group of actual indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the moviebr br virginia
