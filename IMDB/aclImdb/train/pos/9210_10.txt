i feel this is one of the best movies ive seenim an older male and love most westerns i love movies based in part at least on factsif i am not mistaken this is such a movie i also like revenge type moviesthis qualifies there as well in my opinionsome of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode i also enjoyed thati recommend taking the time to watch this movie i will watch it again i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type but i always enjoy his acting
