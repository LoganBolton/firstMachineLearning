gómez pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema just take a look at his curriculum vitae so i didnt expect that much of cosas que hacen in fact i dont know why in the world did i decide to watch it anyway i just did and what a surprise it looks that gómez pereira has finally matured and now hes capable of making a good movie hes last work deals with the midlife crisis the disappointing and the seeking for a second chance after youve ruined it all the last half hour of the movie the more dramatic is the best part and it just makes worth watching the film also we have eduard fernandez playing the main role and i keep on thinking hes the best actor of his generation by farbr br my rate 710
