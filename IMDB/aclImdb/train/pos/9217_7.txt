this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters just about every voluptuous middleaged female in hollywood and a touching funny love story the capomezzas and the malacicis are rival caterers in an italian neighborhood in new york they are also at oppositeextremeends of the taste scale their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet naturally they fall in love on stage the mayhem and confusion that this causes as the parents feud with each other and their kids is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezzas magnificently tasteless home and their magnificently tasteless catered weddingsbr br besides the four overthetop parents and the charming young lovers the characters include a vaguely wise priest a plainspeaking grandma a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed roscoe a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car and two doves there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesnt click in this fast paced moviebr br even the family names of the two families are part of the fun capomezza could be interpreted as lowbrows and malacici could mean stuckup snobs br br if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes you may not like this movie if bette midler embarrasses you you may not like it because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart the rest of us should love it
