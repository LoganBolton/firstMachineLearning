once again i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for 488 fiftypercent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap i mean horrible beyond belief but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good this movie is much better than i expected i found it very engaging though it was obviously made by an amateurbr br  the direction is nothing special but the story is intriguing with some good thrills i expected it to be more of a comedy but i wasnt too disappointedbr br  for a thriller this movie is surprisingly goodnatured theres no bloody violence no profanity no nudity no sex usually these movies require all four of those elements the pg rating is welldeservednot like sixteen candles where the f word is used twice and theres a brief gratuitous nude scenebr br  i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest couldve been developed more the film does tend to be plotheavy and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them we end up watching a careless threeminute montage of them on their romantic endeavors they end up kissing at the end but theres so little chemistry that it seems forcedbr br the dream machine is no gem but its good clean entertainment its quite forgettableespecially with a cast of unknowns except for haimbut its also much better than youd expectbr br  my score 7 out of 10
