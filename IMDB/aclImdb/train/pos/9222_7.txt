there have been far too few mainstream films set in postcolonial africa and the ones that have are a mixed bunch this one with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s shows the best and worst values of africa which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole it also has shortcomings given the undue influence of western preconceptions of africans and especially arabsbr br dr anansa linderby the beautiful africanamerican wife of the english doctor david linderby is captured by arab slavetraders along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy the lead slavetrader suleiman is every bit the stage arab with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to match  which would not be out of place on carry on follow that camel but are not up the standard this film deserves peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful onedimensional characterbr br continuing the stereotypical theme all three of suleimans arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy which thankfully are not portrayed on the screenbr br one of davids first ports of call is the local police officer a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat david then meets two stereotypical white expats an englishman walker played by rex harrison and an american sandell played by william holden sandell is a mercenary with conventional views on mixedrace relationships who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front won over by davids love for anansa and conscious of his own inability to find love he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory  as a result of sandells hesitation and davids lack of experience with firearms his helicopter is shot down but david survivesbr br we then see david introduced to malik kabir bedi an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleimanbr br in one of the most heartrending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleimans group and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlierbr br later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleimans henchmen anansa on her part  and despite the scepticism of the boy  manages to engineer the demise of suleimans two other employeesbr br by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave marketbr br suleiman now in no doubt that anansa is trouble attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince omar sharif who is corrupt but intelligent on discovering that anansa is an american working for the un the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the filmbr br at the slave market the young boy is sold to a middleaged german paedophile and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered wunderbar when his owner is on the receiving end of his witchdoctoring skillsbr br david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bittersweet ending from maliks point of viewbr br ultimately david and anansa are reunited and malik whose life is in ruins can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completedbr br the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting
