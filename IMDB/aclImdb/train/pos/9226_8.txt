id read about flavia the heretic for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane moviebuying binge and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though its been some months since i watched itbr br its a striking film set in italy somewhere around the 15th century definitely medievalera though i dont think any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very wellbr br flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and shes immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but shell continue to see him in her dreamsbr br her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an openair insane asylumthe residents so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trappedbr br the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness we see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pigsty the pious torture of a young nun through it all flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic i disagree with that criticism flavias views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example thencontemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in 1974 revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but thats the sort of minor point it doesnt do to belabor flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the treesbr br flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battlegear and directing the invaders to pull down christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those shes seen commit evilbr br is she the herald of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era werent big on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new bossbr br this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not a massaudience movie at all to be sure its quite good though and doesnt belong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown i think theres much value in the final film and im glad i saw it
