expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipatedbr br it actually has a feminist storyline though i dont think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set it certainly wasnt practiced women and the jews and the poor are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society throughout the story sister flavia florinda bolkan witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just cant sit there any longer and actually does something about it albeit with disastrous resultsbr br the precredit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield she sees an injured evil muslim soldier one of the few still alive and tries to assist him before she can her hatefilled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face great family dynamics huh after this her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice though scenes do involve violence rape and nuns i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation br br indeed many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there but the acting camerawork storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level most nun films ive seen usually have the basic premise of a good girl somehow winds up in a convent where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people andor make their lives a living hellbr br flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strongspirited but slightly loony she likes to pee outside like me but its a lot easier for guys sister agatha when a group of muslims attack their abbey flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns their attackers actually function as their liberators of the cruelty and nearslavery of the abbey in fact it is a christian not a muslim invader that impales dear sister agatha br br it is agathas death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her her father treats her like dirt her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time i dont want to give out too much of the rest of the story but be prepared to be shocked devastated and saddened at the conclusion this is a great film so dont be put off by its undeserved reputation as a trash epic plus how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong i am not familiar with maría casares other works but sister agatha is a hell of a characterbr br i have read many great reviews of the synapse us release but i love my german xrated kult dvd copy it isnt anamorphic169 but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapses releasebr br and there are also many great wise or funny lines of dialogue many from sister agathabr br why is god male the father the son and the holy spirit theyre all male flaviabr br these men are afraid look at them sister afraid their power will be taken away from them sr agatha regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrivebr br woman where are you going the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians havent done ha ha ha sr agatha to a group of fleeing christian womenbr br lord bless these moslems for putting fear into these pompous christians flaviabr br does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you ht your underclothing sr agathabr br closing message flavia gaetani not yet a muslim  no longer a christian  was punished as a runaway nun the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto
