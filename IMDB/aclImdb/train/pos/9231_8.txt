flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre  equal parts sleaze feministic journey and history as we follow flavia on her strange tripbr br we start off with flavia in a conventshe aint too happy there cuz she doesnt believe in all the maledominated rules and machoism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal abraham they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another nonbelieving nun in hastening a moslem invasion flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get busy with the nuns in a strange set of scenes eventually the moslems rollout and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scenebr br this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70s era exploit film  some good gore including nippleremoval and a nice legskinning scene some decent nudity  including the requisite fullfrontal and a decent storyline as well i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points but not enough to get truly bored with it i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit70s exploit fans810
