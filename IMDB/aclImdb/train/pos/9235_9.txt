flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euroexploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored this is an intelligent and complex film beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and its about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent she refuses to accept her being inferior just because shes female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this after a fruitless attempt to escape she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the conventbr br flavia is a downright mesmerizing film almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneerfeminism more intensely than flavia does several sequences are quite shocking on the verge of nightmarish actually as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes torture and mutilation yet all this raw footage isnt just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds mind you im strongly convinced that theyre part of the statement flavia is trying to communicate humanity the catholic church in particular historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and theres no use in denying it any further films like flavia the heretic have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance but its even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography the glorious costumes  scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but its maría casares who steals the show as sister agatha shes a manhating and loudmouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field amen sister
