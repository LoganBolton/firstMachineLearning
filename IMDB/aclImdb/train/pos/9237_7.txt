this movie is pretty good half a year ago i bought it on dvd but first i thought that it was the original film i have seen the series and it is a good film but here they have put the living legendpart1 and 2and fire in space together the same as they did with the first film but with other episodes but still it is a pretty good film only the ending is strange you dont see what happens with the pegasus but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you havent seen it go see it starringrichard hatch dirk benedict lorne greene herb jefferson jr tony swartz terry carter lloyd bridges jack stauffer
