i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations and was not disappointed its funny and the animation is excellent that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so im surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot im an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults it isnt only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but i can see where some parents wouldnt want their young children to see it im very disappointed that it was cancelled i wish they would produce more episodes or perhaps a movie
