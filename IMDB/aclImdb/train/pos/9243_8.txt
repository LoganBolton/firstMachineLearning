dont listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this filmsimply put as regards ninja movies this my friends is about as good as it gets br br yes its silly yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious but by gum  its so much bloody fun in fact as is often the case with bmovies the horrendous acting which in the case of the movie in question is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold and ridiculous plot actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten foldbr br obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part im pleased to say theyre very well choreographed especially the final showdown during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity br br trust me on this if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen sakura killers then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre
