if you only read a synopsis of the plot this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930s the story would seem quite contrived the subject matter maudlin the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct earthy performances of the casti have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling rich and subtle nuances float over her face if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed so true the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son lifts him up and proudly says my kid i couldnt help remember that mr gables own son was born to him posthumously this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema
