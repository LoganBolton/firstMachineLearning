jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie togetherbr br yes hold your man can be cheesy and predictable but thats not what i love about the movie i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful filmbr br the witty dialogue great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail to me that is a mark of a great filmbr br the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period early 30s i adore classic movies but i admit that most of them are just average and at times dont hold my interest hold your man is one of the exceptionsbr br this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a precode movie the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man this movie could not have been made under the code well it could have been made but it would have been an entirely different story thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934 otherwise we would have missed out on this gem
