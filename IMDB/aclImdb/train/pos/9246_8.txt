one of the great mysteries of life suffered from daily is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guysbr br worse when the nice guys even want to marry those girls the girls still prefer the jerks and heels even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt have shown theyre just interested in using the girlsbr br stu erwin is the nice guy who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completelybr br clark gable is the jerk and he is perfect in the role rather a sad note to his fansbr br jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway linesbr br somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters intended to be bad guys  i mean heck theyre locked up so they must be  are so obviously nice peoplebr br in fact there are lots of nice people here people who in a lesser film or story would be snarling and backstabbing but here go out of their way to help someone elsebr br so maybe the story is rather clich√©d at least by modern standards but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watchedbr br the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit once again we can say a fervent thank you to imdbcom
