i expected this film to be a runofthemill 1930s romance boy meets girl they fall in love boy loses girl boy wins her back in the end it wasnt like that at all clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby jean harlows apartment to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub no less instant chemistryshe plays hard to get for a while but a girl can only resist that grin for so long the heat between them is evident and there are some scenes that are definitely preproduction code when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for troubled girls she is miserable and thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her begins to believe that eddie will never come for her harlow plays the hardnosed fast talking ruby perfectly she never lets gable get all the good lines there is an especially moving scene with her playing their song on the piano that is acted perfectly the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time a truly sweet romance
