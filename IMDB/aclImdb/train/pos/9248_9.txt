hold your man finds jean harlow working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble the film starts out as his film but by the time its over the emphasis definitely switches to her characterbr br the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops as hes being chased gable ducks into harlows apartment and being hes such a charming fellow she shields himbr br before long shes involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets gable harlow and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst but then gable wont go through with it of course when hurst realizes it was a con hes still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out but then he winds up dead outside harlows apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughterbr br the rest of the film is hers and her adjustment to prison life her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic cagedbr br harlow also gets to do the title song and its done as torch style ballad very popular back in those days she talksings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well br br gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience a part hed play often most notably in my favorite gable film honky tonkbr br still its harlow who gets to shine in this film i think its one of the best she did at mgm her fans should not miss it
