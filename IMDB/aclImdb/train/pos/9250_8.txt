clark gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hardboiled dame jean harlow he tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her toughgal attitude despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love when gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal harlow to womens prison where she discovers shes pregnant anita loos and howard emmett rogers writing is excellent throughout with many welldrawn and surprising characters including a jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype gable and harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical gable and harlow roles and the direction is much better than youd expect from sam wood one beautiful shot has harlow being inducted into the prison then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her this is one of the best of both the criminals in love and womens prison genres and has some of the best hardboiled dialogue ever written
