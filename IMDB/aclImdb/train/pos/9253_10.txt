well the movie isnt exactly funnybr br okay i admit there are a few humorous lines but definitely nothing that is laughoutloud funny for example right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her okay dont go anywherebr br see humorous but not funnybr br the plot and acting are pretty goodbr br but erika eleniak definitely steals the show shes hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one cant help but rewind and rewatchbr br there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative linesbr br overall 5 stars id only give it three if not for erika eleniak
