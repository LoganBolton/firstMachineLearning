if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor then you will enjoy this flickbr br i dont understand why anyone wouldnt enjoy this one take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh it aint shakespeare but it is well done ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one  better than any episode of baywatch  and shows a knack for subtle humor too bad she hasnt had many opportunities to expand on thatbr br tom berenger fits his role of real navy perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustlerbr br throw in a walkon by hopper in the middle of the chase for the cherry on this sundae and youve got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing i bought this one as soon as it was availablebr br braincandy
