is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story maybe hell you know how the formula works by now pretty woman is introduced in to a picture someone has to fall in love with herbr br i think this film does follow some typical story lines but that doesnt say anything about the content there are great scenes with crispen glover dennis hopper and gary busey although short some things didnt make sense such as the need to get in to random fights but it is entertaining to watch the fights were actually well donebr br this is definitely a comedy foremost but it does have a lot of good feel to it the humor is well balanced you wont hurt your stomach on this but you will keep a smilebr br there is a little bit of steamy action so not one for the kids
