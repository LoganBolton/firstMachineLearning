one word supurrrrb i dont think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring reruns br br i have to say i had my reservations after all critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show but when half an hour was over by the way thank you nbc for running a commercialfree show i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts everything about this show screamed excellencebr br graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek no small feat considering those movies took years to be developedbr br cast was marvelous i am partial to john goodmans voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john special mention lisa kudrows guest appearance she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her panda from brooklyn only in this show br br script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky a note for all parents this is not for children this show was never advertised as such and theres a reason why its set for 9pm not 8pm so if youd like to complain about objectionable context save your breath adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it br br not everything was perfect i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roys characters do i sense stereotype when it comes to them yes they are gay yes they are flamboyant yes they speak with german accents but thats yesterdays news give us something new something fresh something funny putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have thats fine by me but please dont dwell on something everybody already knows by heart hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over br br in general the show is definitely a mustseetv funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there  there havent been a comedy this good since seinfeld i am certainly looking forward to the next episode
