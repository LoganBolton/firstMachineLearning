which do you think the average person would know moreless about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahis latest film entitled offside a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around ones right to do something or go somewhere and an individuals right to extend that courtesy if and when theyd like to the odd thing is you dont come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless its an education in panahis controversial style but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit itbr br i can remember the 2006 world cup im sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain 82 when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeriabr br anyone in britain that was watching the bbcs broadcast of the iran  mexico game both nations first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the bbcs football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match it went something like weve seen giants germany england argentina and holland play but now we get to seemexico and iran battle it out the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore its a shame because there are people and films like offside present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their wellbeing to achieve it and its sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem inferior when there are others whod do anything to have the chance to otherwise engagebr br when immediately thinking of the words iran football and world cup my mind flies back to the france 98 game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around irans famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing irans victory as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they defeat a western power or enemy at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so inbr br a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 indian film lagaan in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket similalry 2005s the game of their lives sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the 1950 world cup the differences between these films and offside are immense offside is looking at a situation behind a states mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men may not will but may use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a mans right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a womans right to see the game all together  it is no wonder panahis film was itself banned in iranbr br but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human bodymind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match panahi pays special attention to the title of his film offside which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an attacker is caught trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the womens position in the film as these advancing supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itselfbr br i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that ive seen its a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neorealist aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrongdoers who dared to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons ive mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the iranian government
