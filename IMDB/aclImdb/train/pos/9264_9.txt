in iran women are not permitted to attend mens sporting events apparently to protect them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans so since men cant restrain or behave themselves women are forced to suffer go figure offside tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who dressed like men attempt to sneak into the highstakes match between iran and bahrain that in 2005 qualified iran to go to the world cup the movie was actually filmed in large part during that gamebr br offside is a sliceoflife comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films the shop on main street loves of a blonde closely watched trains etc that flowed out of communist czechoslovakia as part of the prague miracle in the mid 1960s as with many of those works offside is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative indeed it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effectivebr br once their ruse is discovered the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside stuck where they are all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in guards who are basically bumbling goodnatured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service even most of the men going into the stadium dont seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in still the prohibition persists yet how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction and yet the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a point they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and like all the men in the country cheer on their teambr br its hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous but in either case the actors with their marvelously expressive faces do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing mohammad kheirabadi and shayesteh irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast the structure of the film is also very loose and freeform as writerdirector jafar panahi and cowriter shadmehr rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others with this documentarytype approach we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in real time very often its quite easy for us to forget were actually watching a moviebr br it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much goodnatured humor in the film its what the czech filmmakers did as well the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign offside is obviously a cry for justice but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavybreathing tragedy instead it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audiences common humanity and isnt that what true art is supposed to be all about in its own quiet understated way offside is one of the great underappreciated gems of 2007
