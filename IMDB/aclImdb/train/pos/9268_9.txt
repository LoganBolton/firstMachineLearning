on the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldnt appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isnt about football it is about discrimination and the womens enthusiasm for the sport they lovebr br the film opens on the day of a crucial world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain a girl is trying to get in to tehrans azadi stadium by dressing like a boy it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers whos leader would rather be back home tending his livestock we never learn the characters names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentarybr br as well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the disguise one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer the girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in germany the soldiers arent shown as fundamentalists they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman cant watch mens sports dont seem that convinced by their own argumentsbr br it is a shame that this film cant be seen in iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary iranians arent a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere the cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures
