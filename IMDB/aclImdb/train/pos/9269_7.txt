i probably doubled my knowledge of iran when i saw secret ballot 2001 now i know about four times as much i doubt i learned a whole heck of a lot from not without my daughter 1991br br offside is a splendid budget iranian comedy about a group a girls working individually to attend a decisive soccer match for their countrys place in the world cup women are not allowed to attend soccer matches so the nations armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves some teen girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys but are caught the movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers awaiting some unspecified punishment although the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executedbr br the movie explores the absurdity of the situation the thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexÂ–a philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago this farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she cant see the graffiti the conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urbanbr br fortunately this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the great satan you have to be in the mood for it but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they wont get it
