i dont know why some people criticise that show so muchbr br it is a great funny show  probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but stillbr br the family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried  roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have subplots or oneliners that make you roll on the floor laughingbr br this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for itbr br rating 810
