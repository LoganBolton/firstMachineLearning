i have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against iranian people  if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that im against politicians in general  but if youre looking to be offended  i cant help youbr br not in iran as this movie is banned there see imdb trivia for this movie which is a shame because the movie is great would it not be for grbavica this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlinbr br rightfully so it was the runnerup or second place if you will why because it is a movie about oppression its not even that this is a complete women issue it is about the government trying to keep the people down an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie but by banning it nothing is resolved andor can they make this movie disappear br br another reviewer had a great summary line comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well
