thats what one of the girls said at the endbr br is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls or more broadly a freethinking group and the authority to germany means to a future thats of hope br br its one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience ive ever had  despite the crude cinematography and plot and mild overacting though i like the cast  theyre lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs the ridiculous situation is well captured i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game being female and a soccer fan and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise i wonder why theres no womens section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided  defeating the flawed reasons for the denybr br the movie is very cleverly made  the amazing title the filming during the actual game the spontaneity and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters  the game thats so important but inaccessible not shown the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium the confinement of the van and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside i can feel the comfort coming from the radio the drinks and the food and of course the kindness and consideration from each character to others during the end credits i am amused that no character has a name  hes just any soldier and shes just any girl or sister
