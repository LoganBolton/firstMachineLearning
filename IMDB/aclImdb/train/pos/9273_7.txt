in iran the islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life including everyday things but people still go on living their lives generally just doing the things youd expect like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as its in the running to qualify for the world cup except women arent allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the gamebr br a frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium the absurdity of the situation the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team nothing subversive there and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideologybr br amateurish acting good script and dialogue a really enjoyable film bend it like beckham sort of  a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people
