panahi whose previous films such as the circle and crimson gold have seemed to range from dour to grim has produced in his new offside a funny obstreperous joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun  yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else hes done by focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the preworld cup bahrainiran match in tehran stadium panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independentmindedness and the contradictions  and sheer absurdity  of the regimes religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselvesbr br as the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus with a father pursing a lost daughter this one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint but we cringe with her in the knowledge of whats going to happen shes still easily spotted the thing is most of the men around dont really care still rules are rules and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the wouldbe soccer girls or some of them anyway get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young green and rustic soldiercops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls independent ideas and would rather be watching the game  whose roar we constantly hear in the background  themselves each girl is different  represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it one wore a soldiers uniform and got into the officers section one is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative she could pass for a pretty boy and teasingly hints at that are you a girl or a boy which would you like me to be one doesnt care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade one aida sadeghi is an ardent soccer player herself  and so on these tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them safar samandar one of the rural cops mohamad kheirabadi takes the girl soccer player to the mens restroom of course theres no ladies forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapesbr br later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department  violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice a male gets mixed in with them  a kid whos chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games the van turns out not to be so spiffy the radio aerial is broken but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heartstopping reportage cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now theres no score the game goes to penalty kicks and the winner will go to germanybr br in the background through all this is a real game a real stadium and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event the excitement is tremendous and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitementbr br what makes this film so good as may be clear by now is that its shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around this in contrast to panahis previous highly calculated narrative trajectories is spontaneous vérité filmmaking that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrillingbr br the essence of offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retroislamic social prohibitions repressing women  the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit how exactly do you reconcile the countrys ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval a lot of offisde is astonishingly real including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything the directors decision to inject young actors into an actual sports megaevent leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary polemic and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick and that ends in a way thats brilliant and movingbr br ive had reservations about panahis films before but this one kicks ass panahi does something remarkable here he critiques his society presents an unusual drama and touches our hearts with a sense of a nations aspirations
