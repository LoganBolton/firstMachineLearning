cinema is dead long live the cinema said peter greenaway one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors at the last years romanian film festival anonimul which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta this year the direction prize went to jafar panahis offside i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festivals retrospective cinema is dead but still very lively panahis film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks digitally filmed offside is a story inspired by a reallife event happened to panahis daughter the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match this is forbidden in iran as we are informed what panahi manages to do is to render with few means but with probably a lot of work intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level the absurdity of the laws becomes comical the film has a happy end after all because irans team goes to the world cup what i appreciated most was the concept the idea behind this film i would be very interested to see panahis other films that were forbidden in iran as well i guess that he can be thought as an activist director
