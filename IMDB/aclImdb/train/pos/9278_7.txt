in the white balloon and crimson gold the two other films by jafar panahi that ive seen the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem on the surface slight in offside panahis seriocomic tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights i dont think hes as successful not that what hes saying isnt important of course and its too bad that like pretty much every other panahi film iranians cant see it but after a while the film feels a tad flat and it feels long even at 90 minutes not saying i didnt like it though the actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious but its not an important work in my opinion
