i dont know how and where do the iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this in fact its a very simple plot that many directors could come up with  but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way jafar panahi didbr br the film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time one connected to the other  the football match and the battle between sexes thats going on behind the walls of the stadiumbr br it makes you feel like you are in the movie and youre one of the characters and while watching the movie as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match you will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie its gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending you will want to find out the verdict youll be dying to see what will happen to the girlsbr br i like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee its like venus vs mars it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like iranbr br this is the second movie of jafar panahi that i have seen the first being crimson gold and am looking forward to watching some morebr br am already hooked with iranian movies and this one is a mustsee
