this film is being described as a comedy but it wasnt a comedy at all like any panahi film it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy but it was very funny much lighter than the directors dark and serious the circle my favourite iranian film the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable as if it were a documentary and completely hilariousbr br the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing it added a realism much like australias kenny of course a very different filmbr br the performances from all the nonprofessional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible it was very moving to see the passion disappointment and excitement of these girls anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eyeopenerbr br to me the soldiers represented the current paradigm they started out with stockstandard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls as the film progressed they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration everyone is caught up in it and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and allbr br it was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions frivolity drama and social commentary though its adult cinema i think matureminded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film as long as they can read subtitlesbr br it is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful australian and other film makers could take a leaf out of their book
