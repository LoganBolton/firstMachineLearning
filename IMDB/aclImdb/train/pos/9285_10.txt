finally an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is a nondocumentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass its all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness the nonactors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin 2006 dear reader its nearperfect where where can i get hold of it
