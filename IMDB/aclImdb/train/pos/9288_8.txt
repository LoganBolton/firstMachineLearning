i found this to be a surprisingly lighthanded touch at a 1950s cultureclash movie john wayne would hardly be ones first choice as a cultural attache being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bullrun in harrods but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplished his task with style the duke was a guy who really could act well his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtlebr br despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie many of his good intentions came a cropper he had authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarianbr br the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hellforleather battles i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well there was a great deal of minutelychoreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props the set pieces were complex and detailed a lot of money and thought had been applied to itbr br the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flagwaving effort script was good without being too wordy there was a great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didnt interfere with the narrative it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set whether or not they were japanese i couldnt say but anyway they looked the part at least the leads were not played by crossdressing caucasians unlike other efforts such as blood alley yes i know they were chinese the inn of the sixth happiness or even the king and ibr br frankly i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies the script was better for a start i never liked the songs in the king and i and wasnt impressed by the heavyladen anticommunist subtext of blood alley i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the dukes more popular outingsbr br recommended
