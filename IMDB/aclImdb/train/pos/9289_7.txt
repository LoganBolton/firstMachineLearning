in the barbarian and the geisha john wayne plays townsend harris a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s before him commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853 harris who arrived just a bit later worked through the details and helped ensure complianceas many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty all this is true and shown in the film according to some other sources i found the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film hence the titlebr br my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise john wayne as a diplomat when hes being diplomatic in most films he says please and thank you as he pummels people so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed in fact i cant think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role by the way ive seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at allbr br however despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting the film is still very watchable the color cinematography is nice the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isnt bad all in all a likable and watchable film despite its odd castingbr br psread through the trivia for this film you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director john huston where wayne apparently knocked him out based on what ive read about huston and the way he got along with actors this is an incident i tend to believe and its also a nice example of john wayne diplomacy
