if you like film dont miss this one if you prefer action or horror or romance then youll wonder whats happening everyone here is stuck in a gangster film and what happens is transcendental murderbr br there are few similar films no doubt it will see limited release and be hard to find but the search will be worth it if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol then this is indeed a film to studybr br you cant watch it once if you do youll never see whats happening dark city is better joe vrs the volcano is more fun but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism  or at least to think twice before shooting again
