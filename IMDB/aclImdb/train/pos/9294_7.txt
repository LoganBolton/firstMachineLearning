before i start i should point out that i know the editor of this film weve never met but we belong to the same fanzinethose things which came before message boards and we have talked on the phone so i do have a bias here anywaybr br somehow its ironic how while the rat pack culture of the late 50s and early to mid60s made a comeback in the mid90s this movie from the son of one of the original rat pack and which was made in a similar fashion was a flop not only that it was a critical flop i believe peter travers of rolling stone was the only one who did not savage thishe gave it a mixed review as i recall and while i dont think this is the greatest film in the world and i am not a fan of the rat pack or cocktail culture i do think this is worth seeingbr br for one thing this looks stylish and moves right along for another the core performances are all good richard dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium and has a droll edge to him jeff goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his preblockbuster days like the big chill and while ellen barkin is only required to vamp in this movie she does it entertainingly admittedly its not a great film the dialogue is mostly made up of puns and a lot of them dont worklike the whole zen of ben speech and gabriel byrne and kyle maclachlan are awful here still i was entertained and if you like gangster films you might be too
