it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this allstar flick i laughed through the entire picture as did my entire family the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedythe players were hystericalill bet they had a good old time while making it of course goldblum and dreyfuss were greatand how about those everly sisters each of the two falcos and the divine music throughout rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic not to mention gregory hines burt reynolds the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references paul anka was his usual entertaining self with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his my way welcome home to vick performancebr br i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends dreyfuss imitated him well i am also of the opinion that no one of any age would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movieits a jokenot a terrifying gangsta film the cars and clothing were impressive as was the decorative vics placebr br truly i think of mad dog time as a musical comedy less harmful than many cartoons tv crime dramas and talk shows i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment
