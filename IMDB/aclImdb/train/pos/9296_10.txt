i love this movie its wacky funny violent surreal played out in a madmans head and definitely not your usual comedy br br if you dont find the film amusing then i guess its just not for your tastes so this is a tough one to write a review forbr br for reference some other comedies i love are the big lebowski the princess bride and zoolander that one only got me the second time around there are others but my taste is definitely for the unusual and i am willing to accept that most people just dont tend to like that kind of thing i make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour  at least i have onebr br the scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together the verbal humour is hilarious the situations are intriguing the acting is very good as you would expect of the cast though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high the overall package makes for fun funny watchable yet violent entertainment
