father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation like the simpsons the show centers around a nuclear family of white lions in this case it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan vincent the italianamerican flamingo the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner making the most mundane activities entertaining the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues drugs prejudice etc is the source of the programs brilliancebr br the blame for this shows failure lies with nbc they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote rather than the more logical production order several times the show was preempted for an extra halfhour of such dreck as the biggest loser as if 60 minutes of that was not enough it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominatebr br luckily the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following 1010
