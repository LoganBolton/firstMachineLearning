i dont know much about the rat pack and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too selfconsciously full of himself to me so when i call this one of my alltime faves its nothing to do with a tributeband mentality as another reviewer says mad dog time is about symbolism not realism its kafkaesque a pity kyle maclachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was so good as josef k its stylish knowing sardonic and slick jeff goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others dont whom he can outshoot and whom he cant gabriel byrne and richard dreyfuss his best performance have a ball and the supporting cast look spoton the symbolism the settings the one outdoor motion shot with jeff goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry the dialogue style not practicality is the order of the day its all about characters interacting not really gangsterism fun to watch mustve been fun to do what the critics were up to is really a mystery
