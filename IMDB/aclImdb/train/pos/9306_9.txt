the world is a terrible place but this movie is farce and its fun and if you dont like it you dont get it and if you dont get it doesnt matter its up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun its only a joke and thats good enough for me gabriel byrne is priceless byrne and paul anka doing my way is as vic puts it the best version ever okay its no masterpiece but its not bad i was warned against seeing it but im sure glad i did
