wow how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes it was surely the highlight of my yearnaymy life as if the raptor graphics werent amazing enough the awardwinning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie even when the background didnt actually match up with the setting of the scene wow what genius and while the movie is full of plotholes for instance a few clips of a trex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber screams colins a girl and runs out i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet thank you scifi for another classic
