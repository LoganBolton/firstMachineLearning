i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors i like raptors because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the bananabr br i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but its okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think its got a good ending even though i didnt really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and thats the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if youre watching it the first timebr br this is best movie
