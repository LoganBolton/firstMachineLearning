for me this movie was powerful i dont want to be a spoiler but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers this movie brought back some vivid memoriesbr br for some reason i couldnt place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 i kept getting a message like no votes have been placed and yet i saw in the stats that there were will try again tomorrow mondaybr br minor flaws i overlooked it was the relationships between the characters that got me beautifully acted and real situations ive been in a couple of thembr br a small gem of a movie just like spring forward is another overlooked gem im very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people well written sensitively unfolded with firstclass acting and direction after all isnt that what its all about
