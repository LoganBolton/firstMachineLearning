ive read a few of the reviews and im kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over its easy to do because its not a book its a movie and theres only so much that can be done in a movie us or canadian or anywherebr br colm feore does at least for a recovering fghag like myself a great job of not only playing the friendly neighborhood gay man but playing sick i mean the man really cant get much more pale though you might never know it from the strip down near the um endbr br if you need decrepit there are a few sking movies you might likebr br being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic the druggie brother david cubitt was the trick for me im going to give him cred he grew up quick and believe me thats good and as an aspiring writer moimeme i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews but im more prosy than poeticbr br i may be easy to please but i enjoyed it a nice story pretty well put together by canadians quelle surprise just toed the line of the movie of the week missing it by not being as drawn out greatly appreciated and it was rather cleverly portrayed
