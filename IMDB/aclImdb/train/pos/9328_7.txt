the perfect son is a story about two 30something brothers one who is seemingly perfect and the other who is basically a screwup frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers after the death of their father the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces it isnt until the perfect brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order and take some responsibilitybr br the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brothers comeback though it may seem a bit farfetched at times beating drug addiction is never so easy what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 510 years and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and welldone the two main actors were both very competent if not terribly charismaticbr br a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids the ending is nicely done as wellbr br
