dangerous offender is the story of a seemingly antisocial girl and how she got that way its based on a true story and though i was irritated by the onenote depiction ie ever scowling of the title character and the hardtobelieve dedication of her lawyer im forced to accept that life does imitate art and that there are people out there like thatbr br the movie succeeds for me because although theres little softening of the title characters demeanour until almost the end one is gradually moved to sympathy for her as the movie shows how she got to her present state  which proves to be selfdestructive rather than antisocialbr br truly a moving movie which will bring a lump to your throat when you think on it  which will be oftenbr br despite its many flawsincluding that its hard to watch sometimes because of bodily functions and suicide attemptsthis is another production that im proud to call canadian
