i have to admit this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears however i always think about things twice and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable i prefer taking the risk of a closer lookbr br first whats first the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slowpaced movie that doesnt try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 911 thumbs up for this stroke of genius because unlike stones world trade center this film fortunately doesnt focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating the psychological impact the sheer devastation that 911 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 911 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscarbr br however in the film blood diamond the di caprio character says and i quote ah these americans always want to take about their feelings now i dont want to belittle their suffer√≠ngs but i sure would like to make a comparison ever since 911 the entire world is confronted with mementos memorials and commemorations of 911 the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 911 in their works now this huge amount of cultural products dealing with 911 turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject and i say this with all due respect blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportionbr br fact is people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people we have a war in iraq in afghanistan in birma and lots of other countries on a daily basis we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 911 simply because they are black and because their lives dont have much in common with our western lives africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can so what i am saying is this the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 911 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 911 not a day goes by without a newspaper article a film or a book that discusses 911br br in conclusion i commiserated with charlie fineman but i wasnt sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil warbr br you catch my thrift
