most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11 2001 what you probably wont know before seeing this film is this how that would feel what do you do with that and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson don cheadle and excollege roommate charlie fineman adam sandler solidifies and begins to take shape characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact stay with this story and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable  and accurate real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates the pain inside charlies soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by sandler as layers of an onion  one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined its so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen cheadles alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle always watchable the ease thats apparent when cheadles on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills alans relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture just as the situation would demand fineman doesnt want friendship nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlies carefully sealed life there is inherent danger in the process the more alan nudges charlie to open up going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst liv tyler the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge its an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss unfortunately his grief is one thing he cannot deny sandler withdraws so deeply into his characters pain during the storys unfolding that by the time he meets his demons headon the viewer shares his pain almost equally alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect homelife  run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane jada pinkett smith while tending to charlies recovery alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost the theme is much like the fisher king another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss like the fisher king the story concludes with the traditional there is someone for everyone theme reign over mes lidia sinclair played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king is donna remar saffron burrows a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnsons who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlies borderline insanity its a good ending to the story but the one element probably least likely to ring true then again maybe there really is someone for everyone devorah macdonald vancouver bc
