what weve got here is a situation a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him  in contrasting ways at the end they are forced to let it go you cant fix people and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood that message isntbr br this story is not about charlie fineman adam sandler a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 911 plane whos gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since its about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson don cheadle a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and knowing about his tragedy spots him on the street and reconnects charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter  a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic  with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair the hair is sandlers chief prop to show hes deranged and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipodwielding subway riderbr br charlie is a disaster but paradoxically alan stuck with a controlling wife jada pinkett smith soon begins to envy him charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund insurance money from the tragedy and starts dragging alan off to hang out eat chinese buy records or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady redoing the kitchen over and over collecting old vinyl of springsteen the who etc and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living roombr br charlies inlaws are deeply concerned about him but also somehow resentful as we learn later alan has a new patient who is propositioning him charlies desperation makes us see alans trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of thembr br cheadle and sandler make an odd couple but that doesnt matter because its convincing that they might both need each other charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family because to escape his loss he is pretending he never had one and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste no motown alan wants an escape from his tidy emasculating life hes under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners who lord it over him though its he who set up the practice theyre white by the way and hes blackbr br theres also the lascivious patient from hell who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices shes a babe his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute hes also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need helpbr br sandlers mad scenes are a little too theatrical as are a lot of the plot devices in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touchingbr br charlies not just delusional and sad but dangerous and violent and all these efforts to help him start to backfire the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people cant be made right this is an interesting movie  sometimes a touching one  and its the first time 911 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times many of the people are too broadly drawn and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful d√©cor only the manhattan streets look real theres a courtroom scene that is preposterous and donald sutherland is a judge whos too good to be true alans family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call and yet this is worth watching for the acting  the control and subtlety of cheadle and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in pt andersons 2002 punchdrunk love though thats clearly a better movie in fact a much better one
