i didnt really go into reign over me knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story the plot was easy enough to understand i suppose this guys whole family died in 911 and he shuts the world out of his life alright i didnt know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it and it really doesnt on a very obvious level so if youre scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours i wouldnt worry about it i think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention september the eleventhbr br overall i was impressed it was a very moving picture the movie has a sense of humor and it is very sharp but it is definitely a drama where it counts i typically dont like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting but sometimes lets be honest they are adam sandler is definitely capable of it and though i think so you may disagree jim carrey is also very wellrounded sometimes sandlers portrayal of charlie fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan johnsons don cheadle in another excellent role if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictureswife who is played well by jada pinkett smith calling her static and dull but that is completely untruebr br she has depth but some of it gets hidden behind the main story which does drift in and out of focus occasionally which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie with a weird make everything out of focus fadeout after about the first 40 minutes they arent used anymore maybe its significant for the characters outlook artistically or maybe they just realized how irritating it was the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point one of several but definitely the most explicit of the story which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way maybe it seems unorthodox to us maybe it seems downright unhealthy but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget to just exist the films soundtrack was excellent and it used music to pursue and amplify moods rather than establish them which gives credit to the actors and the writersbr br the movie takes its name from the song love reign oer me off of the whos rock opera quadrophenia the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax and at the very end the movie is paced well and does not feel like its dragging anywhere in its length which is a little over 2 hours if you can accept adam sandlers portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man you will enjoy the movie you will become entangled in the story and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it it is not the best movie of the year and theres nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it but its a very enjoyable watchable movie all in all
