as someone who has never condescended adam sandler in terms of talent as is done to him and many comic actors like him i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it he will make you weep especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue whats amazing about his role is that its a character its hard to say weve seen before weve seen many emotionally scarred characters many mentally retarded people many loners many passionate selfcentered artists but sandlers charlie fineman is none of these he may have a taste of each of them in some ways but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual its a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems mindset and provocations are completely different from most characters like himbr br don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level he is every man he is the most normal possible person in the world so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson whose name is even found on the assembly line cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny jolting smart and stupid the way so many normal people arebr br the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses whove hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles jada pinkettsmith is the overly refined upper middle class wife donald sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge robert klein is sandlers desensitized fatherinlawbr br mike binders script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises its much more subtle than say babel and has a much more closetohome idealbr br the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style this film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchensink style of the 1970s cinematography was grainy and unfastened but that was its charm it wasnt about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that wouldve diluted its stories with suchbr br the music which plays a major role in the film and its title is very powerful near the beginning you feel like youre in for another about schmidt or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack but you soon realize youre in for more than that in fact the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenesbr br reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself it goes to show that even the director of blankman is capable of wonders
