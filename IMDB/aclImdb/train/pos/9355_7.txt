time and time again it seems that the comedic actors of hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers first it was robin williams one hour photo 2002 then it was jim carrey eternal sunshineÂ… 2004 being one example then will ferrell stranger than fiction 2006 and now adam sandler yes thats absolutely right the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless goofball comedies im not complaining ive always been a fan has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud of course some readers may be wondering whatever happened to punchdrunk love 2002 but i can only assure you that its a film im currently taking measures to see as soon as possible since ive heard its terrific my first film from director mike binder reign over me is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship though it does occasionally stray into alltoofamiliar territory the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving with both sandler and don cheadle giving memorable performancesbr br alan johnson cheadle is a successful dentist with a good family though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife jada pinkett smith and so his marriage is a little shaky charlie fineman adam sandler is alans excollege roommate a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief a disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes often likened in appearance to bob dylan charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry and spends his time in solitude listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world driving around manhattan in his motorised scooter immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wifes final wishes when alan and charlie meet for the first time in years the latter doesnt even recognise an old friend having completely abandoned any memories prior to his lifecrippling experience indeed at first he doesnt even acknowledge the existence of his family and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counsellingbr br initially it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the september 11 attacks as a storytelling device afterall wouldnt it be just as devastating if charlies family had died in an ordinary everyday car accident however if you consider that the directors intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy then reign over me does a very good job its easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks this is the first 911orientated film ive seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who werent even involved whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved adam sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task snapping instantly between cheerfulness anger and depression charlie fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise a hollow soul who thanks to the companionship of an old friend can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark bleak tunnel
