i saw this at a screening last night too i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusionbr br i wont bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better but i will say that adam sandlers performance was really refreshing and real he was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies don cheadle was believable as alwaysbr br this movie isnt funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it id say 90 of the audience laughed for most of the film midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all togetherbr br i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friendwhite friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves
