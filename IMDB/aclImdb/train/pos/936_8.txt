everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories  a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains so that he can avoid his partners fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past present and yet to come so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late a rather morbid tale one might think but it is classic charles dickens and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all timebr br to me this is the definitive version of dickens timeless story its the one i always remember watching in school and i remember being absolutely terrified by it the ghost of jacob marley the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge and the ghost of christmas yettocome especially i found very frightening how on earth did the film gain the u certificate for nonuk readers u is the lowest classification it means family friendly and children welcome nothing to scare them etc this is certainly not the case though as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaperlike spectre of christmas futurebr br be that as it may from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film this is possibly the most faithful to the book most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text  that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his robe youd never get away with a scene like that nowadays the two children represent ignorance and need although changed to want in this filmbr br criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes the main one of which being that george c scotts portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough he laughs too much i dont want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man rather than the positively unkind cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed and michael caine despite acting alongside the muppets was positively cold further the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirits final lessonbr br but ignoring this one albeit major quibble it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heartwarming christmas tale as all christmas films should be london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snowcovered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is the truth is that even then that london was grey and grimy  and any snow would never have been so white and everyone is so impeccably dressed too even the poor people look rather dapper but of course its a christmas film so why shouldnt everything look nice perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of its a wonderful life miracle on 34th street and the snowman and youve got everything you need
