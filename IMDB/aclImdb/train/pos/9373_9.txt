like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing  the 1940s noir films  but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past the term neonoir has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact john dahls film on the other hand truly deserved to be described as such the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes james m cain would have appreciated it many contemporary films leave me wondering why they dont make them like they used to and im not even that old movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past
