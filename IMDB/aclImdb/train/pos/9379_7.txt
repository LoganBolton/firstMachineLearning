the more i watch nicholas cage the more i appreciate him as an actor watching this movie now in 2005 i can see that it doesnt really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s i dont really think it can be considered a film noir but it is pretty dark at times due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the charactersbr br typical performances from each of the three main actors who all did a good job with their roles i thought however that hopper and boyles characters were left undeveloped as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy the plot is really good and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic there were parts where i had to hand it to the director ie when he first sees the sheriff all in all this movie is definitely worth watching 12
