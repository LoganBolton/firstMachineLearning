an excellent example of cowboy noir as its been called in which unemployed michael nicolas cage loses out on a job because he insists on being honest hes got a bum leg with really nothing else he can do he decides that for once hes going to lie when he walks into a bar and the owner wayne the late great jt walsh mistakes him for a hitman whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne lara flynn boyle in fine form michael plays along and accepts waynes money then he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands intentions and accepts her money to get rid of wayne if that didnt complicate things enough the real hitman lyle from dallas dennis hopper in a perfect role for him shows up and michael is in even more trouble than beforebr br red rock west gets a lot out of the locations director john dahl who cowrote the script with his brother rick was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes its also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation its an appreciably dark and twistladen story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt have at least been morally compromised like michael the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing even if the writing isnt particularly logical or credible the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right inbr br cage does a good job in the lead but his costars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greedmotivated characters hopper boyle and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs deputies in one especially good twist walsh is also the local sheriff and theres an entertaining cameo role for country  western star dwight yoakam who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tunebr br its quite a good little film worth checking out it moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is certainly never boringbr br 810
