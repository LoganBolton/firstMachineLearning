red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget all you need is a smart script good actors and loads of atmosphere rrw delivers all these and morebr br nic cage plays an exmarine injured in lebanon who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne jt walsh not quite as his most menacingbut still evil for a hitman from texasbr br he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary only when he gets there just to check her out she offers him double to kill wayne cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yoyoing in and out of red rock back and forth eventually this leads to a runin with lyle from dallas a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper the real hitman from texas who offers to help without knowing hes making the plot more complicatedbr br rrw never had a big release thus most of its audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but its bigger than that the slick slowlytimed direction moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtvbr br the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyles boring femme fatale with the nasty dykeish hairdo i certainly wouldnt fall for her but if you assume that nic cages character is in to militant lesbians then youll accept it nonetheless
