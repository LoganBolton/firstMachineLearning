as others have commented i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year what a gift i then went out to buy it just so that i could loan it outbr br best quote dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone cage is on top of his cab when cage peers down he apologizes im sorry if i scared you yoakum thrusts his pistol in cages face with does this look like im scared great bit of humor after an exciting and temporary escapebr br there really was a sense of fun to this the constant sighting of the welcome to red rock sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake the music created a hunting eerie quality to the film reminiscent of twin peaks unlike twin peaks though it doesnt spoil things by going too far into the outlandish needing to top itselfbr br i admit watching the credits 1520 times you see they had yoakums thousand miles from nowhere perfectly chosen playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor   with snowcapped mountains in the distance this was incredible fluid framing further ive never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film also it totally fit the story
