although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his overthetop and largerthanlife interpretation of ebenezer scroogebr br particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movies end as scott stands before a large window sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette augmented by scotts voice a ponderous growl the effect is galvanizingmuch like marlon brandos first scene in apocalypse now the horror indeed br br however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie it proves infectious to put it another way the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after even though he really shouldnt be its what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies stage and screen alikebr br actually i myself dont consider scotts glib rage a liability but other christmas carol purists might see the film and judge for yourselves
