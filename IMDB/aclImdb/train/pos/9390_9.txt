this movie started me on a nick cage kick it is a story full of twists and turns a movie of motives and moves of course dennis hopper was a ham but jt walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web everything about this movie is good  cinematography story pace and most of all the end cage excels at what he does best its not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life
