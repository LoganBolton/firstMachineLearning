i came home late one night and turned on the tv to see siskel and ebert summarizing their picks of the week i didnt hear anything about red rock west except two thumbs up and see it before it went away it wouldnt stay in theaters very long because of the distributors money problems and lack of promotion but they said it deserved betterbr br the next afternoon i followed their advice they were right it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies as some readers point out there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes dont ever seem to end but its well worth it for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour its the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage but almost everybody seems perfectly cast dennis hopper goes almost over the top which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scenebr br when i rented it later for my family it didnt work as well the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate with the distractions at home it deserves your full attention turn off the phone make sure you wont be disturbed watch and listen to every scene especially in the beginning
