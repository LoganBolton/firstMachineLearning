in any number of films you can find nicholas cage as a strong silent hero dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac lara flynn boyle as a vamptramp and the late lamented jt walsh as the heavy these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche what a relief therefore that john dahl a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action directed this nuanced noirish thriller hopper manages to keep from going over the top cage shows a little more depth than his usuallysuperficial action heroes boyle is by turns sultry innocent and scheming and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character wayne dahls direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store the plot twists are topnotch and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains it isnt often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors but with a director as smart as dahl you shouldnt be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film an excellent movie
