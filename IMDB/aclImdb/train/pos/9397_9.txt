vaguely reminiscent of great 1940s westerns like the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 red rock west is a story about conscience greed and betrayal michael nicolas cage is a down and out but honest young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money he finds both but not in the way he had expectedbr br the films screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists excellent cinematography adroit film editing and moody western music add tension and suspense the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting and the acting ranges from good to excellent with great performances from dennis hopper and jt walsh dwight yoakams specially recorded countrywestern song provides the film with a strong finalebr br correctly labeled as neonoir red rock west strikes me as being something else as well the plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed ordinarily i would agree in this case however when combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that beyond noirish is  surreal its almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself from this point of view the coincidences are not script flaws at all they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons  disguised as other charactersbr br all we need here is rod serling in a postscript explaining in his always clearly enunciated voice that  a young man searching for himself stops in a small almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere its his final layover in a journey to  the twilight zone
