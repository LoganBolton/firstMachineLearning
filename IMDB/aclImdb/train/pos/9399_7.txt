this is a film i saw when it first came out and which i have seen a few more times over the years its always enjoyablebr br one thing is that the comedy does not take sides it skewers labor and capitalists equally only sid seems outside the classic struggle even though hes responsible for it br br spoiler warning do not read further if you havent seen the film br br this is a fantasy though presented fairly plausibly ask yourself could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric it would cut through almost any supportbr br also when cornered in an alley sid uses a garbage can cover like a knights shield cute symbolismbr br someday ill get this on dvd
