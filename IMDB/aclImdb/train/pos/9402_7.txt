i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years needless to say the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic but still alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial postwwii englandbr br this is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case its a fabric that doesnt wear out wrinkle or even get dirty of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thickbr br guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast those brits  always the stiff upper lip when under fire the film might chug along exactly like guinesss goofy invention but its a good ride all the same
