ok im biased i live near shrewsbury in england where this wonderful movie was filmed it still looks the same now i remember them filming here quite vividly and the fake snow on the streets for days on end often when im walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this filmbr br george c scotts scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions his physical appearance isnt the typical miser scotts is big and imposing a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferiorbr br we all know the story and the quotes the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language and i dont believe there are many cynics who would say that people arent capable of change and redemption this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully george c scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skillbr br i love this movie if you havent seen this version i would strongly urge that you do its usually available for a very small amount of money or are you too mean
