i enjoyed this film but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy it was amusing at times but really it wasnt very funny at all if id been expecting it to be a comedy i might have been disappointed with the film but going in with no expectations i found it to be enjoyable and engaging maybe it was because as an engineer i identified with the protagonist i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention a man whos less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production hes absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park me i compare it to the fountainhead
