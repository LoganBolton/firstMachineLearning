although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars alec guinness produced an amazing body of workparticularly in the 1940s1950sranging from dramas to quirky comedies i particularly love his comedies as they are so welldone and seem so natural and real on the screenfar different from the usual fare from hollywoodbr br this being said this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies its plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhereexcept for ealing studioswhich had a particular fondness for little films like this onebr br guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work so he tends to sneak into labs either during the day if no one suspects or at night and try his hand at inventing repeatedly he is caught such as after he blew up the lab and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds then despite the importance of the discovery he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of eventsand then the fun beginsbr br the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry unions the government and people in general
