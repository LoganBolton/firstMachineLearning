this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry and a light eccentric character study as wellbr br the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy and none of it is really rollingonthefloor type funny except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments but it does have its amusing moments and it is very deft in its execution the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical elementbr br the union procedures are quite droll very reminiscent of im all right jack especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness character the political machinations actually carry the story ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavybr br i dont think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers or kind hearts and coronets but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing
