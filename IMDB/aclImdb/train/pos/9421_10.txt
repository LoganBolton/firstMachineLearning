contains spoilers  also my quotes may not be exactbr br everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels  how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this  his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriatebr br thats ingenious  can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrolbr br the only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all  standing there almost naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work hes never really intimidated by people rememberbr br but sidney we want to stop it toobr br barely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused nobr br also notable is dapnes role she is sick and tired of money and power she thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company at first she doesnt really care about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him  and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is that its not even romance it is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit its more admiration and perhaps even inspirationbr br upon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust what a refreshmentbr br thank you sidney if you wouldve said yes i think id have strangled youbr br i love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his stride matching the tune dauntless where is daphne we dont really know  but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist he got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope pollyanna a contd relationship wouldve been nice but as billy joel says its more than id hoped forbr br
