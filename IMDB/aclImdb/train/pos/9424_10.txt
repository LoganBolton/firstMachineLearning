for me this is ealing studios most perfect film  as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was releasedbr br as a satire on economic notions of growth and the commercial need for inbuilt obsolescence it could scarcely be more uptotheminute and of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plotbr br oddly there are parallels with jurassic park in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you but spielberg shied away from the books brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about children hmmmbr br in the man in the white suit alec guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out suddenly workers and capital at the northern english mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoodsbr br of course being ealing its a comedy but it neednt have been the complex interplay of vested should that be suited interests plays out beautifully as one by one all parties realize that progress is a threat and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turningbr br but yes this is a comedy  albeit a pointed one  and amid the political ironies are delicious performances and some good oldfashioned knockabout laughsbr br nonetheless its the biting satire that endures  dazzling and white
