a super comedy series from the 1990s two series were made in total that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling when you are up against established comedies like minder even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticedbr br luckily i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly i mentioned it to friends and family at the time but everyone seemed to have been watching something else very very frustratingbr br anyway i loved both series and never forgot itbr br then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultrafan was trying to get both series released on his ownbr br well both series are now available on dvdbr br httpwwwreplaydvdcoukjokingaparts1htm
