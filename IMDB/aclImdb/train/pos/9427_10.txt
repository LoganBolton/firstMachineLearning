deliverance is a deadon example of what wonderful movies came out of the 70s while your jaw is dropped during a terminator movie are you really sacred i dont think so because you are there to see what new cgis have been strung together  plot matters notbr br so many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all because there are so many people involved in daily living  like a trip to the marketor a walk down a dimlylighted street deliverance is so frightening because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heartbeat venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun anyone who has that notion does not read the papers watch the daily news nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of trespassing into territories where outsiders are not welcome it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on deliverance didnt inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic and squeal like a pig wasnt a part of deulling banjosbr br i hate the term hillbillies because  as some users wrote  that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how  without the interference of modern life much is made of inbred  that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods chinatown should teach us that lesson however cityslickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude i know lots of hillbillies  they are moral people when left to themselves their justice can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated just like the justice in city streets they dont need any part of the city  the city should take its canoeing and camping to legal sitesbr br deliverance was the last film i found jon voight to do any real acting  i hope im wrong he was extremely underpaid for midnight cowboy because he was unknown but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat his acting in deliverance was superb it gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains if its necessary  but who wants to be thoughtof as ordinary today his stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant wow for burt reynolds  one must ask what led him into those other tacky films his manliness although misguided in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness  not only in the backwoods but the wilderness of everydaylife ned beatty was stellar  his underwear may not have had versace stitched on it but his shellshocked performance was perfect as noted he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie ronny cox played the moral guy to the hilt  every man should have his determination to do what is right several users have theorized he was shot or lost his balance when he pitchedinto the river  my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey he committed suicide no gunshot was heard during the scene and voight and beatty did not find a woundbr br james dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale and was great as the sheriff  it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day his character could see the three canoers were guilty of surviving but also knew they didnt stand a chance against a jury of the local people no matter how kindly they were treated in aintry he was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel justice   dont come back up here again not many users knew hillbillies were used in the film where ever it was possible  what actors could portray them better the mountainmen were actually mountainmenbr br every detail of this movie was perfect  no doubt it was dangerous to play in play in better fightforyourlife in ive experienced some neardangerous incidents and am content to live outside of the fray  you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my partbr br that we have absolutely killed  and continue to do so  irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable to be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it los angeles where i live is a perfect example its builtup right into the territories for wild animals and steadfastly believes humans come before animals those are their rightful habitats  we should leave them be just that any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods theyre theirsbr br in some less threatening way we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from deliverance  to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy i thank all those cityslickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic so that it can scare the heck out of me when i watch it you can have the thrill of danger  ill stick to the tv 30outof10
