this is the best film version of dickens classic tale ive seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is formatted for tv not widescreen what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other filmsshows in north america since 1984 my biggest surprise is edward woodward the equalizer as the ghost of christmas present
