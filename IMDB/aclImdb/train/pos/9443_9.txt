its a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos even people that have seen the film cant get their mind off of that rape scene its not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction its certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scenebr br the acting plot cinematography and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to its brooding charisma the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them br br the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires not many films can make you feel this creeped out bottom line this movie is a classic i cant really say much more than that
