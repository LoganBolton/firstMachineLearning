you could stage a version of charles dickens a christmas carol with sock puppets and ill probably watch it ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories maybe its the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when theyre on tv as they inevitably are this time of yearbr br what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles lines weve heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemblebr br george c scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oftportrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man as he is so often portrayed but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits we understand how this anger took root grew and ultimately strangled his soul as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately softening and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy and in the great dramatic scene when he kneeling and weeping at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully humanbr br impressive as scotts performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this versions dark beauty fred holywell scrooges nephew is an excellent example of this often portrayed as an affable buffoon here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals when he implores scrooge i ask nothing of you i want nothing from you why cant we be friends we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at scrooges selfimposed separation from his only living relative it is a moving performance and one of the movies most dramatic scenesbr br even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooges late partner jacob marley in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because its difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly ooooh look its a scary ghostnot in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie marleys entrance as the locks on scrooges door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy but finlays marley is no ethereal spirit he is a tortured soul inspiring both horror and pity marley may be a ghost but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress are still very human as portrayed by finlay we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition finlay really steals the scene here something not easy to do when youre opposite george c scottbr br and it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like youre experiencing this story for the first time edward woodward remember him from the equalizer is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present when he delivers the famous line it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spankingbr br susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs cratchit and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty a sick child and an insufferable boss his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his weariness in the face of intolerable circumstances later in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim warners performance while hardly uttering a word will move you to tears
