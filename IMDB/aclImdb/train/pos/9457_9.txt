how can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is for several weeks this dvd leaped off the shelf at me every time i went in the store  having seen steve carrell in a couple of films previously i didnt want to smear my thought process of him  so i resisted and resisted until finally i grabbed it up with a what the hell attitude and how surprised was i i just wish i had purchased it earlier having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife who thus meets an intriguing woman charming her in such a profound and interesting dare i say bookish way throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching forbr br the snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters  which portray dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin seeing his someone special bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life you just really begin to feel for himbr br then when the blind date occurs with ruthie draper  that is the turning point in maries estimation of dan the look she gives him when he repeats her comment about not liking ruthie  sheer greeneyed monster triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor this sequence is one of the most wellcrafted as dan starts to loosen up with regard to mariebr br other gutwrenching scenes  dan returns from the book and tackle shop confronted by his brothers begins to describe what has just occurredwhen dans face drops it brings a sharp intake of breathbr br his youngest daughter lilly making the present celebrating their love for suzanne his late wife brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as dan realizes just what he has lost in lifebr br when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent showhis voice cracking slightly as he reprises the songabsolute gem br br the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughtersthey all three love their father and want to see him happy will not let him deny his love for marie the desperateness of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock their strongholdand tell him so much more than that with just a few wordsbr br i could go on and on but i will leave it for now  maybe return and add more comments here in the near futurebut i will end by sayingbr br if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama that never feels forced or crass that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life  not just with a woman but also with his extended family then look no furtherbr br dan in real life  9 out of 10 for such a wellrendered cinematic experience with a score by sondre lerche that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive with fine performances by the ensemble cast i cannot wait to rewatch this again
