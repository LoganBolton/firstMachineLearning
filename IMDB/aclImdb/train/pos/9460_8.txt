i loved the story somewhere a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film well maybe there ought to be i thought everybody seemed really human and believable what a top notch cast what great music on the soundtrack what a nice this and what a nice that but most of all i will say two words to recommend this filmbr br steve carellbr br he really showed a nice subtle depth that touched me he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first at the cost of denying his own needsbr br did he act like a petulant ass why yes he didbr br and you see thats what was perfect about this film the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something and not simply acting like he was feeling something and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling and what he was feeling was deniedbr br denied happinessbr br denied fulfillmentbr br denied lovebr br losing your love is painful beyond belief and many who do so will never feel something like that againbr br beautiful filmbr br i gave it an eight out of ten
