i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know im not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bitbr br dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brothers girlfriendbr br this movie is pretty well made the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all topnotch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with dane cooks character we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steves characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dans inner conflict about being in love with danes girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies weve been getting this year
