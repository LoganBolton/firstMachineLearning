i was lucky enough to see this at a prescreening last night oct 20 and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt actingbr br while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh unique and distinctly indy in style it isnt something that can easily be compared to films of the past its a unique take on a sort of classic middleaged depressed love storybr br i was particularly struck by the casting of the film down to every last extra in the family it was a beautiful and talented cast the three daughters did a wonderful job the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them outshone the other twobr br it was truly a delightful film appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films
