i got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it its not the typical romantic comedy i cant remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it the laughs arent gags heretheyre observations laughs of recognition little shocks of oh my god i thought i was the only one who felt that way i wont give away the plot which is more than just guy falls in love with his brothers girlfriend the whole family plays a part in the relationship here probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since while you were sleeping br br steve carell goes much deeper than hes gone before and for the first time i really liked him the cast is amazing a list of veteran theater actors whom ive loved in other roles but they blend to make a convincing family dianne wiest is lovely as the mother juliette binoche is luminous and hilarious who knew she was funny and even the reviled dane cook gives a warm quiet touching performance the sondre lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition and ill buy the cd the second its availablebr br dont miss this one
