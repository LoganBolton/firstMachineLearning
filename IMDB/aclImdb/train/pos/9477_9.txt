this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationshipsbr br eventually they do become spoken but is there a chance to change anything about the situationbr br originally made in shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious filmbr br a young married couple  liyan an invalid and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruinedbr br a bright contrast is liyans young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way her spirit is as bright as the other two are reservedbr br into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitorbr br i ended up feeling quite sad  but definitely a superior film
