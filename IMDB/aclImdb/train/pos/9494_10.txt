white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs he claimed its one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made i generally dont watch movies knowing that theyre going to be bad but i made an exception for this one and i was very glad that i didbr br its filled to the brim with action much of it surprisingly graphically gory sleaze isolated to nudity with a key female character but theres so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious and outrageously awkward dialogue all of which adds to the laughterinducing tone of the filmbr br ginty the unusual looking star of the exterminator and countless other low budget action turds is amusing in the lead giving the best performance he could muster williamson is better than usual clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee and he doesnt come in until midway through the rest of the cast is also fun to watch particularly the villains one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mishmash of spanish and italian shes pricelessbr br again i cant stress enough how gory it was its not so bloody that its nauseating but its uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget also when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beersbr br dont miss white fire its a rollicking  if mindnumbingly stupid  action classic
