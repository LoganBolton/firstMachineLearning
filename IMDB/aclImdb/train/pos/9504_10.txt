as many people know mexican cinema was very poor after the socalled golden age of the mexican cinema fortunately during the late 90s and early 21st century great movies like la ley de herodes bajo california amores perros y tu mamá también and of course el coronel no tiene quien le escriba appeared el coronel is a wonderful movie that retells the classic story by gabriel garcía márquez by eliminating the magic realism elements and replacing them with the crude reality lived in mexico not only by people like the colonel who wait for their pensions but by more than the half of the mexican population who live in complete poverty the films characters satirically represent classic characters found in mexican society such as the nationalist colonel the cold and even ambitious priest the hypocrite but at the same time loyal compadre the tolerant and patient wife the hidden homosexual etc this movie is a mustsee if you want to know more about mexican society and specially if you want to watch a gorgeous movie by one of mexicos finest directors
