this is one of the best movies ive ever seen it has very good acting by hanks newman and everyone else definitely jude laws best performance the cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special to me it takes a lot to beat godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest definitely a best picture nominee in my book
