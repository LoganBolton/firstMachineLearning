an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era i loved the visualsvery fitting for a story connected to a graphic novelbr br i thought tom hanks was really great in this he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work which he didnt fully choose for himself but still wants to have a normal life for his family he does the best he can to see that happen dont want to spoil the plotbut you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot em up actiongangster format it is violent though
