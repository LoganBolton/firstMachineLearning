i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens story but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because its a very creepy ghost storybr br scotttypecast as scroogeis shudderingly mean and nasty making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving i think its up there with his performance in patton the spirits are all effective each one creepier than the last watching the dark floating skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year and what a supporting cast david warner in particular is in top form as bob cratchit as is susannah york as his wife br br i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most othersbut i may be mistaken as its been several years since i read it regardless this is a terrific christmas classic
