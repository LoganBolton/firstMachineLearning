this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this filmhe comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges smelling like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks character shoots and kills all of the men in mr rooneys group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul newmans characters face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom hankss character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite moviesbr br tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me
