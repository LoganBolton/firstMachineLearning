road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newmans score  its haunting and beautiful but youre aware that this music is similar to newmans other work and while listening to the soundtrack youre reminded of scent of a woman  meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption youre reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen  as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway  irish gangsters is millers crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leones gangster epics despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldnt be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed  but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you cant help thinking what a superb director mendes is br br road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances  ive never been all that keen on tom hanks but hes every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role  probably better  paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent  newmans performance works due to the subtle body language  his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top  while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadnt decided to become james bond  a role which heralds the end of an actors career
