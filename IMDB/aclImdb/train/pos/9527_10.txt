this is the best mob film ever made it deserved more then what it got at the oscars nominated for things like its score art direction supporting role newman this film could have easily been nominated for best picture director mendes actor hanks supporting actor newman and law and won hanks gives one of his best performances and the kid who played michel jr was so good that im surprised i dont see him in more movies today critics themselves didnt give this film enough credit but besides the incredible performances another real star of this film is the incredible music this was by far the best score of the year it was nominated but didnt win this is a great film that should be seen by everyone my gradea
