frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractorsbr br the opposite of perdition being lost is salvation being saved and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts the movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the fatherson relationship it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themesbr br the premise is that the fathers in the move hitman michael sullivan tom hanks and his crime boss john rooney paul newman love their sons and will do anything to protect them but rooneys son connor is even more evil than the rest he kills one of rooneys loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father when connor learns that sullivans son michael witnessed it he mistakenly kills sullivans other son and sullivans wife in an attempt to silence witnessesbr br sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of perdition rooney who in one scene curses the day connor was born refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan and hires a contract killer named maguire jude law to kill sullivan and his son so rooney joins his son connor on the road to perditionbr br for the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young michael sullivan pursues connor rooney down the road to perdition and maguire pursues sullivan when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family rooney says  michael there are only murderers in this room and theres only one guarantee none of us will see heaven as the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character repentsbr br im not a big tom hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hitman sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and laconic performance newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by connors misdeeds jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way tyler hoechlin plays young michael naturally and without affectationbr br the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness echoing the themes of salvation and perdition the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era illinois the greens belonged to the younger sons and that states rural flatlands thomas newmans lush sonorous and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in coplandlike arrangements the sets were authentic midwestern urban  factories churches the homes shone with gleaming woodworkbr br the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography the only negative was a slight antigun message slipped into the screenplay y the movies only nod to political correctnessbr br i give this movie a10 out of 10 in time it will be acknowledged as a great film
