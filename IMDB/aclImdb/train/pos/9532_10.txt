i loved so much about this moviethe time taken to develop the characters the attention to detail the superb performances the stunning lighting and cinematography the wonderful soundtrackbr br it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that wont work for anyone who wants the typical fastpaced action flick if we lived in elizabethan days id say this movies a bit like a shakespearean tragedy but since we dont lets say its more like a dramasuspense moviebr br the plot is simple but the story is complex the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored much of the story is shown rather than told which i find makes it more subtle and moving  and which also works well for a story based on a comic book or graphic novel at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s part of this story  there was such a realistic yet dreamlike quality in the style of its tellingbr br i dont often prefer movies to the books they were based upon but in this case i do though i did enjoy the book too ive bought the dvd which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentarybr br i also took my little cousin whos a little younger than the boy in the movie to see it after i saw it for the first time because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on fatherson issues with him he loved it  and the discussion
