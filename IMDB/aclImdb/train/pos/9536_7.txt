deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborgzombie like machines which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infectedbr br technically superb horror comedy is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying good taste prevents me from describing what happens here but lets just say its pretty gruesome if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film personally im not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going onas revealed in the endi want to go back and see what it was i didnt catch on to there is an internal logic rare in these filmsbr br 7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else
