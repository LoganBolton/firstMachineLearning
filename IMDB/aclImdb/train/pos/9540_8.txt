most of the feedback ive heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed a couple even saying that they think it sucked well to those people i say get some fckin imagination and go fck yourself this was a very entertaining flickbr br the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwarcostume looking deathbots called necroborgs eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you which then is able to control your actions due to hotwiring your nervous system unfortunately for two loveseeking lonely young adults they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered is there a way to stop the transformation maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat why do the necroborgs fight one another do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty only one way to find outbr br going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions but it turned out being a great surprise a few unanswered questions some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of from the anime feel to it to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses with a everdeveloping story thats interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool makeup effects and blood splatter this is one flick fans of bizarrohorrortetsuosplatter fans should check out 8 outta 10
