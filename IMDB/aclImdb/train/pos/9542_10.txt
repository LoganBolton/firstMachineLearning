dont be fooled by the silly title folks this is one sweet ride a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll it seems that aliens are taking over peoples bodies and modifying them into warmachines which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species the winner of the battle eats the loser alive thats mostly it for plot but who cares when the gore is this good i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used but its disgusting to behold there is interesting and effective use of stopmotion when the takeovers are in progress and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and makeup effects the cgi is a bit limited but that actually doesnt detract from the overall quality one bit at least for me this was truly a fun and stomachturning film that deserves much praise and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics find it and watch you wont be disappointed
