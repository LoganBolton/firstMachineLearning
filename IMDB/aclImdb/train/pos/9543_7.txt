the japanese cyberpunk films have never really done a whole lot for me but of the handful that ive seen most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining meatball machine is no exceptionbr br the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts takes control of their bodies turns them into necroborgs and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other  apparently as a game for the enjoyment of said parasites the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other but whose loveaffair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites and are forced to fight each other it becomes a test of humanwill vs the parasites control over their physical bodiesbr br meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo as most cyberpunk films are and for good reason there are definitely some thematic parallels though the films are definitely different theres plenty of fun splattery moments in meatball machine and the creatureborg fx are definitely the highpoint  a mixture of tetsuomeetsgwar that are both elaborate and inventive depending on your taste for these types of films meatball machine may or may not be your thing if you enjoy hyperkinetic cyberpunk films with a healthy dose of splatter  this ones for you710
