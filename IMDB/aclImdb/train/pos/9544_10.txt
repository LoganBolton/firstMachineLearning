meatball machine is an amazing splatter film it has an original plot with young love buckets of blood and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machinesbr br now the film isnt for everyone people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo the iron man will applaud itbr br the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriouslybr br yet all in all its a lot of fun well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles
