directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi battlefield baseball and junichi yamamoto meatball machine is apparently a remake of yamamotos 1999 movie with the same name i doubt ill ever get a chance to see the original so ill just stick commenting on this one first of what is meatball machine  a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore its not something youll end up writing books about but its nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinemabr br meatball machine follows the well known plot boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date boy finally meets girl girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg boy in turn does also transform into said thing and goes on a quest to save his love will he succeed who gives a damn as long as there is carnage and death im satisfiedbr br the plot is simple relatively clich√©d but it does its job well enough setting the movies course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives and yes it too luckily shows more violence im happy acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film its not exactly painful for the ears but its not exactly good eitherbr br the movies main attraction besides the violence and gore like i havent mentioned that enough already are the cyborg designs done by keita amemiya whos work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and videogames is well known the necroborgs as they are called in meatball machine look stunningly detailed without the usage of cgi amemiyas designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal painfully awesome in their appearance able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws rocket launchers bloodfiring shotguns and so on and so on though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film necroborgs are amovie classbr br meatball machine is tetsuo the iron man mixed up with alien all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode its an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking
