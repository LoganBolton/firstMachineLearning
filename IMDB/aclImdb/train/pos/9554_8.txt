lock up your daughters is one of the best highspirited comedies i have ever seenbr br it is misunderstood since it lacks the social commentary values that many films of the day 1969 required to be successfulbr br the characters are overthetop satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actorsbr br christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington a noble with hair too big to fit in the doorbr br the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff mistaken identities thwarted romances corrupt government officials and jokes at every turnbr br it answers the questions what happens when 4 rambunctious eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town and who do they get involved with and how does it all turn outbr br despite doing poorly at the box office it has great costumes excellent musicbased on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name greatlively acting and sets that are obviously authenticbr br that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame since so many bad movies are released every day
