when our local tv station first launched it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming lock up your daughters was duly aired and i  swayed by the opening few seconds of the film  popped in a blank tape best thing i ever didbr br the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life complete with appropriate accents christopher plummers foppington will leave you in stitches as will hoyden and her family double entendres abound plotline wheels within wheels mix and match the characters hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene and risqu√© comments are made on a regular basisbr br i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece a lost treasure as much for the cast as for the story to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release ill be at the front of the line
