i love this anime i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence mostly from akane ranmas reluctant but short tempered fianceeis so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amendsclumsily the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water from then on its pure chaos one after another among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi the sexy shampoo the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our heroheroine however it is ranmas selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time if anyone want an anime thats funny this is the one its cuter and better with the japanese dub
