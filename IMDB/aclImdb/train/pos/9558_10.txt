so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene with very few shows i simply will not watchbr br this show however i would recommend to anyonebr br quite possibly the most original series to date its got just about everything i could ask for a side story so to speak about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to a very blatant comedy and a very well put together voice acting cast both japanese and american translationbr br if not for the terribly funny aspect to it it would be just another animebr br more or less as i have noticed a love it or hate it very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for itbr br original to the core with everything you could ask for in an afternoon bet the house on this series im ready to assure you that you will enjoy it
