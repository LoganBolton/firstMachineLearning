admittedly i first picked up ranma 12 when i was around twelve i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read then i went to the comicmanga section and spotted this book at my first few reads through the chapters i didnt really know what was going on but i knew that i loved it i even took it home for a few more reads over frankly i wasnt getting anywhere and then about five months im 16 now ago my friend was watching some anime series and i remembered about this manga i couldnt remember what it was called but recalled that the author was rumiko takahashi creator of inu yasha i googled it and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes at first i was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics but it didnt really matter in the end no anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind watch again i once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day i dont know how i did it but i couldnt stop eventually after about two days i grew obsessed i even dreamtas crazy as this soundsabout watching ranma never have i found a series so enjoyable so funny and so heartwarming to watch to this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading br br ranma 12 is about a boy named ranma saotome and his dad genma saotome intense martial artists they are so intense that they went to the ancient training grounds in china and became cursed the grounds were full of different pools of springs and if you land in one you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water for genma that was a panda and for ranma that was a girl its a very crafty fun loving story on top of that genma promises his friend that ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the tendo dojo alive course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual obviously they start to like one another but both way to stubborn to admit it but genma has a history of doing this he promised ranma to many girls br br trust me its worth watching its humorous heartwarming and all around amazing
