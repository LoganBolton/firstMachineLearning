first things first edison chen did a fantastic believable job as a cambodian hitman born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed in a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in cambodianthai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone elses leashbr br like danny the dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each others throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others its a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller productionbr br edison plays a hired gun from cambodia who becomes a fugitive in hong kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry leading the chase is the team led by cheung siufai who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti sam lee whos inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kongbr br the story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hitman and the cop on opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey with the hitman we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl pei pei bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold the cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done there are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how antihero despicable strategies are adopted youll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances  do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end if i should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre  extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment listen out for the musical score too and youre not dreaming if you hear growls of dogsbr br highly recommended especially if you think that youve seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre
