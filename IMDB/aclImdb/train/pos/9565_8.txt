dog bite dog isnt going to be for everyone but i really enjoyed it full of slapping stabbing and shooting but dont worry  the leads a terrible shot it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia edison cheng plays pang a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister despite being filthy from his journey hes almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant if this sounds wildly implausible to you you should probably avoid this film it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief and i had a lot more fun for itbr br chasing pang down is wai sam lee a young edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him and his father a legendary good cop is in a coma following a drug deal that went south the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealingsbr br there are a car crashes lots of killings and a strange and awkward love story on offer here all played out in almost comicbook style i suspect the humour was deliberate nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd though the overthetop nature lost a number of my fellow audience members there are at least three points where the film might have ended and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing or the deletion of one of the narrative threads the lighthearted stuff worked well so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathersbr br im inclined to give it a high pass however if only because of the ending  ive rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
