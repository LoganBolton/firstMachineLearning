some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from pousoi cheang isnt really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison however it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action is your thingbr br edison chen plays pang a cambodian hitman who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge sam lee is wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost with wai closing in on his target pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeÂ—until he meets yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abusebr br a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from chen and lee as well as newcomer pei pei as pangs love interest dog bite dog is one for fans of hardhitting asian hyperviolence think along the lines of chanwook parks vengeance trilogy stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheangbr br of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments dog bite dog crosses it in a laughably overdramatic final scene pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on a now dead yue delivering their baby moments before he himself diesbr br whilst this film might not be a classic slice of hong kong excess with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals its still worth seeking out
