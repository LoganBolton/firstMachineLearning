as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 ive purchased thats been made recently i wasnt sure what to expectbr br a cambodian hitman goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hitman because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hitman pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hitman proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hitman in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hitman to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie its like a rollercoaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hitman the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking theres no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended
