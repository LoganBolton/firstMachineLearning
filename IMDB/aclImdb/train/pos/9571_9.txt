i gotta be straightup  i havent seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while im a big fan of the oldschool late 80s to mid 90s era catiii films and i had been hearing that that style of films is making a bit of a comeback with films such as this and herman yaus gong tau which as of this writing i have not yet seen so i was very interested to give some of these newerwave catiii films a shot did this film live up to my expectations absolutely  but not quite in the fashion that i imaginedbr br the story follows a young animalistic resourceful and virtually unstoppable thai hitman with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a mission due to some badluck he is quickly identified by a roguish copy who exudes many of the same qualities as our hitman and is quickly apprehended and captured this state of affairs doesnt last long though as the unnamed assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly the hunt is on and a catandmouse game between the police and the mad dog as the police refer to him ensues along the way mad dog is inadvertently befriended by a slowwitted young woman and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation the ante keeps getting upped as mad dogs only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary and the cops keep trying to reel him in alivebr br i could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film but i dont want to give too much away i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise and i think its the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way as to comparisons to the olderstyle catiii filmsthere are some similarities dog bite dog has some hyperviolent moments reminiscent of the good ol days but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as oldschool classicks like the untold story or red to kill where many of the older catiii films main intention was to shock  dog bite dog is a far more thoughtout and wellrounded production though thats not to take anything away from those catiii films that i hold so dear this film is far more emotional than it is exploitative and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides there really are no clearcut good and bad guys as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer theres also no nuditysex in this film which is a typical characteristic of the older catiii films personally i would compare dog bite dog more to parks sympathy for mr vengeance or perhaps the pang brothers bangkok dangerous as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence again  theres pretty much nothing that i didnt like about this film the acting is deadon the cinematography is sharp and well done and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isnt seen very often is this film and others like it the rebirth of the catiii film  not exactly  but it is a very solid film thats absolutely worth checking out910
