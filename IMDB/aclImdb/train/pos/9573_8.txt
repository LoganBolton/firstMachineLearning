wow if you think that a film cant fatigue in some way then you havent seen dog bite dog this film pulls no punches and it doesnt shy away from showing very disturbing images at all much like salo this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit it is gritty dark depressing and hopeless but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of hong kongbr br the script is much more of the same but dont go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd it basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game against a professional and emotionless hitman while the script offers nothing new on the surface it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity is violence really that necessary do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child without pity without remorse in turn we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger this is a sad truth it is a topic that the director brilliantly explores without limiting himself at all besides the cat and mouse chase the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters one is about love and the other is about redemption even if the script isnt that new it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times br br the acting is really really good edison chen as the hitman is incredible he proves that he isnt just any pretty face he is ruthless vile and beyond likable sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding the supporting cast in short is excellent the music is also worth mentioning very somber score by ben cheung with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film the cinematography by yuen man is also really goodbr br overall this catiii film is highly recommended very well paced incredibly acted marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all however as many have pointed out this is not a movie for everyone if you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one if you dont like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isnt for you too in the end a powerhouse film 810
