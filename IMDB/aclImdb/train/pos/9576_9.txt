one of the most nihilistic and brutal films ive ever seen but also one of the most tragic and moving ones this is an actionmelodrama like the world has never seen it before sometimes the plot got me close to tears while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bonecrunching blow to the guts chilling performance by edison chen the story of a hkcop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down while bit by bit losing their humanity is a strong one featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camerawork dog bite dog is pure hkbloodshed without the heroism
