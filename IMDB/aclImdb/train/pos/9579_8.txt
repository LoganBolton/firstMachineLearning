most reviews say that this is the weakest point in hamiltons short movie career this movie is a bit different from the rest and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie and what you expect from hamiltonbr br knowing hamilton as a photographer you can be slightly surprised while bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian with a plot connecting these scenes laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them malefemale artistmodel but though we see beautiful photos many of them better than his average their number is reduced for the sake of the plot tendres cousines is different from both it is only hamiltons movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than hamiltons fans looking like an erotic comedy but not german softcore type  schulm√§dchen report fans would be very disappointed you wont laugh a lot but you can smile and thats something you dont often get from hamilton unlike all other hamiltons movies the age of female varies unlike other movies main character is a boy unlike his usual works this one isnt put out of place and out of time we have characters that live their life have their destiny and dont lead us only from one photo to another from one nude girl to anotherbr br unfortunately hamilton again gets lost with a script in his hands girls on beaches under shower in lowlight rooms in gardens under tents in front of mirrors regardless of the amount of clothes  this is his territory he can shoot minutes and hours and whatever he does youll always feel the artists eye and hand behind it but when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script hamilton is best known for his nudes but they are just a part of his work and in tendres cousines we have a reverse situation his girls are not in the best shots nature garden house remind us on hamiltons work often neglected part of it while girls even when nude dont have anything special in the way he presents us maybe hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept maybe he was really trying to make something new and no one dared to tell him he shouldnt but he neglected what he was mostly praised for
