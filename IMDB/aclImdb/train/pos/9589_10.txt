growing up in nyc in the late 80searly 90s clubscene i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights voguing allowed people to fight within the confines of everything short of touching each other which would warrant an automatic disqualification seeing these kind of extraordinarily talentedwell orchestrated throwdowns in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are herepepper la beija paris dupréextragavaganza etcall commemorated in the likes of such periodpieces as malcom mclarens song deep in vogueit didnt matter who you were or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this magic kingdom of sorts you became part of something bigger than yourselfyou were importantand most importantly the creation of your own moves and imaginationand anybody from anywhere could become king or queen as the case may have been the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor all of the tension excitement and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film brilliant please release on dvd for the world to see thank you
