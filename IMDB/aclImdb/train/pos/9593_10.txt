first of all i am a butch straight white male but even with that handicap i love this movie its about real people a real time and place and of course new york city in the 80s i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them no matter what the consequences thats courageous you have to admire that this is a great film watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties its real life bottom line its real life
