in the beginning of this film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him he is black and male but in addition to that he has a third strike hes gay youre going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined he is told paris is burning is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexualsbr br the miracle of paris is burning is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity we learn their views of homosexuality men women their hopes their disappointments their dreams some of these dreams are so unattainable its tragic many of the people are seriously in denialbr br this is not a film for everyone there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals if you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie isnt for you but if you do see this movie youll realise paris is burning isnt really about men wearing womens clothes its about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large and what they do to get a sense of community in their livesbr br ive watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things its a commentary about materialism in our culture about gender roles about rich and poor people about the media and what it celebrates about fame and adulation paris is burning is one of the most humane and one of the saddest movies ive ever seen
