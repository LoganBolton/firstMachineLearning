this was the best movie ive ever seen about bulimia it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how its not always about being skinny and dieting it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life friends and themselves the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is is when beth saysits not about you that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem it showed that people with bulimia dont have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else it has to do with them and them only it shows that its time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her moms attention at that time the most
