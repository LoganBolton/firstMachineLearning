this was surprisingly intelligent for a tv movie and quite true to my own experience of bulimia it was actually wellresearched and i can only assume it was written by someone whos gone through a similar experience because it had all the little details the characters were quite welldrawn and the performances by mare winningham and alison lohman were great i think what i like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for beths bulimia it wasnt some diet gone out of control caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media pressures were not actually going to address her mother wasnt completely clueless  too often on television theyll take an issue that everyone has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who dont diabetes whats that oh my world is all askew doctor please explain it all to me as if im a small child etc it was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didnt see the signs and the scenes where beth was throwing up werent overly melodramatic and sensationalist and concentrated more on bulimics need for secrecy and their outofcontrolness the scene where beth tells her mother shes bulimic wouldve made me cry if there hadnt been other people in the roombr br okay so i liked those bits what didnt work for me so well was the ending which headed back to the tv movie territory we know and dont particularly love but i guess they had to wrap it up you too can cure your childs eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in americabr br and can i just say again that i really like mare winningham shes great
