this is a great movie most of us have seen jurassic park where the chaos theory is summarized by telling about a butterflys wings causing a tornado on the other side of the planet well bug is all about that or at least something dont worry this is no spoiler im definitely not a religious type and dont believe in predestined stuff fate etc but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really existsbr br further more the acting and camera are excellent too another prove that its still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
