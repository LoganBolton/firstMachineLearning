there are so many hollywood movies made now that are not only torture to watch but also have no bearing on anyones life whatsoever granted movies dont always have to have deep meaning but its nice to know that there are still filmmakers out there who care about telling human stories i wont give away the premise of this brilliant film however the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones i have ever seen in my life and im a 32yearold film buff too bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites which includes on the waterfront sunset boulevard and black narcissus to name just a few this moving movie should become one of your favorites also that is if you have a heart
