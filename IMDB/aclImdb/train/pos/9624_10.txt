the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in betweenbr br rob stewart is a wonderful actor i dont know why people keep giving him a bad rap as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob its only by five yearsbr br rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel im sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller janebr br he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini seriesbr br they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at
