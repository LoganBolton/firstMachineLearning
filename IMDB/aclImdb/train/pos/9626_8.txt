warning spoilers aheadbr br  spoilersbr br  ive seen movie in german so it might be that i missed some cluesbr br  despite some weakness in the plot its a movie that came through to me i liked especially lexa doigs acting sometimes i got impression that she is camille but i cant stop wondering what happened at the end with bob cassie and baby i belive she after initially being set on bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him otherwise its a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it its up to viewer to decide  and i dont like such endings dean cain was as good as ever eric roberts  well ive seen him better but also worsebr br  i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime storybr br  bottom line is i liked it very much
