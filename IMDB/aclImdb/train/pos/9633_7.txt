in many ways dirty work is a predictable lh short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someones chimney  guess what happens next  thats right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues br br but theres one or two things that seem untypical  ollie for example is very unlikable  hes arrogant  hes rude  and not only to stan look at the way he addresses the servant with  hey you  and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being  i have nothing to say   in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where hes always at his funniestbr br dirty work also lacks the reportary regulars of the other lh shorts like finlayson  long  busch and housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline theres a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie br br having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan  also watch out for a scene featuring a fish  many jokesplots from lh feature fish and this is another one
