this is an unusual laurel  hardy comedy with something of a split personality at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short happily each portion is funny in its own right and the boys seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the films disparate elements into an entertaining whole while ive never heard a fan cite dirty work as his or her favorite laurel  hardy comedy its nonetheless one that everybody seems to likebr br our story is set in the home of professor noodle who represents one key element of the storyline a wildly overthetop parody of mad scientist scenarios this marks a rare venture into scifi territory for lh abbott  costello and the three stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than stan  ollie in any event the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger while his sarcastic butler jessup expresses the viewers skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip meanwhile stan  ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the professors home the very day he perfects his solution their portion of the film consists of characteristic but firstrate slapstick involving the chimney the roof shovels and a number of unfortunate mishaps if you dont enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably wont like dirty work but for fans of the team this movie is a feast the highlight comes when ollie plummets through the chimney lands in the fireplace and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision one by one i also like the shot of ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse the process work is so slapdash i suspect it was something of an inside joke the way wc fields movies would feature the worlds worst rearprojection screensbr br the slapstick stuff is great fun but its the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat prolific character actor lucien littlefield is terrific as the professor delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee while sam adams is a stitch in the less showy role of jessup the butler as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime its always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave their films an enormous boost so too usually did the background music of le roy shield but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits mood music might have enhanced the proceedings but no matter this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow and a prime example of what made laurel  hardy so popular in their day
