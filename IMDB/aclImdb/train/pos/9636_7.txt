a lonely depressed french boy mathieu jeremie elkaim on vacation in the summer meets and falls in love with cedric the gorgeous stephane rideau quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie on one hand i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys on the other i was getting annoyedthe film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason its very confusing and pointless br br spoilers aheadbr br also there are tons of plot holesmathieu at one point does something that ends him up in the hospital what is itwere never told then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else hes living with him why were not told then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end why no explanation its clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much if only things were explainedbr br elkaim as mathieu is not good hes tall handsome and has a nice bodybut he cant act his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his faceall the time rideau on the other hand is great hes very handsome has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him there is full frontal male nudity lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is greatmost movies shy away from showing malemale love scenes this one doesnt and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each otherbr br so a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeingespecially for rideaus nude scenesthat is if you like goodlooking nude young menbr br
