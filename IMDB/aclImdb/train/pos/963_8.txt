takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think hes succeeding still this was the first of his films id seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i didbr br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didnt treat kids like theyre stupid and this one doesnt either the dark underlying morals are there but its also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasnt bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and dont think kids will noticebr br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuringbr br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films zebraman the happiness of the katakuris sabu and the bird people in china br br good job takashi miike 810 stars
