there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationshipone based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning and there is also emotion in the innerworkings of mathieus family dealing w his mothers problemsand how that comes to bear on their relationship but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered unless im just too dumb to pick up on them why is mathieu in a mental hospital what led to the boys breakup and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills or some male nudity but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying
