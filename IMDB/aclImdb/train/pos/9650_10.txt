i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch stéphane rideau had participate still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful «les roseaux sauvages» in portuguese juncos silvestres by andré téchiné i was searching for similar movies in the come of age line i found then «presque rien» a movie where the director sébastien lifshitz deliciously amazes us earning a nomination by the cannes festival in 2000 the story is about two guys the kind «boy next door» mathieu jérémie elkaïm and cédric stéphane rideau who meet during the summer vacations in a land far from where he lives mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister there he meets cédric a local with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that stéphane rideau gives his characters in «les roseaux sauvages» 6 years younger he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer witch matures here in experience exemplar in directing in the amorous sequence in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his still ambiguous sexuality and great love the first love in its terrible progression ecstasydespair the best of the film is the best of france the fervent passion the hot and excited rationalism the brownish beauty the simple and natural acceptance made by the families although not without surprise and first anger still there is the beach the luminosity the lightness e simplicity of summer the freshness of breeze the surge8217s melody and the expressive eyes of an introverted elkaïm hesitant hurt puzzled passionate the sex is not avoided nor exploited it is treated as it is with no exhibitionist intention in virtue of pure talent this is a work of drama of uncommon quality without cheap sentimentalism showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person although with a social fear of rejection and shame it is well worthy being seen especially by those who adore french movies although the dvd front cover is very lame with the two actors in between tens of stars greased with brilliantine a movie witch in my opinion deserves an 89
