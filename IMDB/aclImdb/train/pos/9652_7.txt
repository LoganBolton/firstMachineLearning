i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog and i wasnt impressed right after i watched it however after a few days i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind my appreciation of this movie increases it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettablebr br as many have commented the movie is nonlinear and thats a hallmark of european filmmaking as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood favors i dont really know whether its true or not many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations to those viewers i dont think there is much i can say to change their opinions however for others who have yet to see the film do expect to be challenged and dont expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwisebr br the movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods it is also not as confusing as suggested just enjoy and itll all be clear at the endbr br yes lots of things are left unsaid or not shown and lots of situations are left unexplored but isnt that what life is like a lot of time youre not sure of the motives of your friendsloved ones unless you confront them and even then you can never be 100 sure if they told you the whole truth this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions the movie does however leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions for example mathieu is manic depressive to the point of suicidal why i dont know maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it maybe he misses his family but hasnt forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric rearranging and indeed shattering his life to be with him he realizes that it is all coming undone i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off mentality fragile by that scene w the dead bird maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him but were also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w the stray cat also there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt the doctor asks him if everything is okay and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once but thats nothing according to cedric is that the only reason we dont know there are probably others all mixed up together is it paramount that we know exactly what they are i dont think so for this movie another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene mathieu is interested in studying the ruins cedric is not he is the one w the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needsbr br finally the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the endbr br i have two complaints for the dvd one is the sound its very soft i had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene it became too loud the other is that the subtitles cant be turn off they stay on the screen most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately
