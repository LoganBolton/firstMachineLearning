first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema  the allencompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or worse slightly ridiculousbr br lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving sexy thoroughly engrossing tale of love disaster and possible redemption while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existencebr br the core story is of mathieu 18 a solitary introverted boy who meets cédric brasher more outgoing but just as lonely while on holiday with his family as the summer warms on they fall in love and when the holidays end decide to live together a year later the relationship ends in catastrophe cédric cheats on mathieu who distraught tries to take his own life he survives and in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met this time cloaked in the chill of winterbr br if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does much of it is implied all of it happens nonsequentiallybr br the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective fortunately the three timelines used the summer of love the postsuicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction are colour coded warm yellows and oranges for the summer an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seasidebr br both main actors put in excellent performances though whilst its a delight to see stéphane rideau cédric used to his full capacity im more used to seeing him understretched in gael morels rather limp dramas jérémie elkaim mathieu has to be singled out for special mention you can feel his loneliness then his almost incredulous passion then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever couldbr br the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling our difficulty in communicating fully the shifting sands of meaning the films title presque rien almost nothing points to all of these and indeed to one of the key scenes in the film in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him non enfin oui une fois mais ce nétait rien no well yes once but it was nothing cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt none of which we see and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever because something that seemed nothing to him a meaningless affair is everything to mathieubr br whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest it is not without hope we get to see cédrics slow painful attempts to get back in touch with life first through a cat he adopts then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre who may be his next love but here the story ends a teenage passion over within the year another perhaps beginning so what was it almost nothing certainly not when youre living it
