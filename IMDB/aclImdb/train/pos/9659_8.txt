presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything its almost too realistic as theres little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch
