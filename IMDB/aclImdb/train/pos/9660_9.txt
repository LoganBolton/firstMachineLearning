only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie and after reading comments from all the other posters here and thinking about it some more i decided that i liked it tremendously i love american films  probably because they are so narrative they usually have a welldefined beginning middle and end presque rien on the other hand makes no such attempt i disagree with other posters that say its too artsy in every way this film is meant to evoke your sense memories so often throughout the film you feel like youre there you feel the summer sun the breezes the heat the winter chill the companionship the loneliness etc etcbr br in every way the director pulls you into the lives of the characters  which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them after i finished watching it i felt the same but upon some reflection i recognized that this is how the movie had to be the story isnt the narrative its the emotions you the viewer feelbr br the lighting scenery and camera angles immerse you in the scenes  theyre rich exquisite and alive with detail and nuance although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot after all isnt a movie supposed to tell a story this film is definitely one of my new favorites
