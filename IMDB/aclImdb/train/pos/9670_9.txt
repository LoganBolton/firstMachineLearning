one of the best movies i ever saw was an irish movie titled philadelphiahere i come i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both its the story of a young man preparing to leave ireland to go to america because he cant earn a living in ireland it is told both from the perspective of the young manwhom the other characters in the film can see and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film it is a very sad movie but deeply touching and i would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about i love any irish movie or almost any movie about ireland and any film that has the late irish actor donal mccann in it gets my votei would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen and unfortunatelyi haveterrible shame to have lost him so young
