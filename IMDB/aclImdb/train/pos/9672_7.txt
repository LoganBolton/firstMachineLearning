i know i know its childish but i just love this type of movie a bird that suffered a lot of mishaps and still hasnt lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor whats special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie the parrot and hes not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor furthermore i like the storyline paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom by the way jay mohrs voice almost sounds like joe pescis and cheech marin of course the man is humor to me ever since i saw up in smoke i have appreciated his naive way of performing making a simple situation a hilarious one cant help myself
