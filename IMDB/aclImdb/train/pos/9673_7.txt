paulie sounds like the most saccharine lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find yet its actually much better than you might expect the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film but actually in most other departments the film is charmingbr br in case youre wondering paulie is a parrot bought for a little girl with speech difficulties paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a superintelligent speaker himself however paulie is sent away by the little girls mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from nyc to la to be reunited with herbr br so why does this awfulsounding film succeed relatively well firstly it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline thirdly it has several surprisingly strong performances including jay mohr as a wily crook gena rowlands as a kind old lady and cheech marin yes the dopesmoking cheech marin as a musical immigrant it might not be a classic but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages
