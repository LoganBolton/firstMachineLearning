i didnt give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like citizen kane and seven samaurai however this movie is so allaround wonderful its a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter however the imdb voter leans to the geeky and paulie doesnt qualify for thatbr br the only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didnt portray the perfect stuttering child im sorry but asking a 6 yearold child to outdo dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in filmmakingbr br moving past that minor complaint the movie has the best of many films buddy roadtrip congames hero as friendly partyanimal partybird disneylike humor for young and old etc whats not to like tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans thats normal for him it seems im russian i like long stories i dont like mangoes but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one watch the movie and that will make sensebr br buddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy and his onscreen role fits that as well the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulies voice in the end even that works well put parrot and antiparrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its ownbr br if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either paulie is a perfect candidate i will however admit that a happy moment colors my review of paulie i was on a roadtrip during a major heatwave the cars airconditioning died half the restaurants had dead cooling as did our hotel and i said lets watch a movie where there is working airconditioning so we did so for 100 minutes we were cooled amused and given a heartwarming experience when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances i realized just how well this movie was madebr br its a sleeper film you wont regret watching
