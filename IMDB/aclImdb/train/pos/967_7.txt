what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and bulky bigbudget fantasy this is takashi miike had already proved by the time he got to the great yokhai war that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crimeyakuza genre visitor q and andromedia showed this the former great the latter lesser but here miike in his first and only coscreen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a postmodern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it boatload of cgi creatureeffects and makeup and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kidsasbigheroes powerhungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source machinery as the greatest evil and many bizarrely defined flamboyantly designed creatures or yokai of the title but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the gungan battle in tpm and to the whole powerplay between good and evil with similar forces or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to hensons films and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or overreaching moments its miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters br br here ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world but will become the hero in a world going into darkness the darkness is from an evil sorcerer who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures the yokhai into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission to destroy and kill anything in their paths tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once satos main minion and cohort agi kill bills chiaki kuriyama another great villainies steals tadashis little furry companion a sunekosuri soon things come to a head in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories but can only be contained up to a point by miike and his crew i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids but in the forward note that its not some watered down fantasy in american circles this has creatures galore including a oneeyed umbrella stand and a walking talking wall not to mention a turtle a fire serpent and a woman who became cursed by sato so the variety is on high on that end and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects which grows to unfathomable heights when the festival hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope but theres also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miikes disposal and not just because its cuteness squared where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form br br yet through all of this the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miikes career is here as well which distinguishes it from its animated muppet and scifi counterparts theres the bizarre humor as usual including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes i loved for example the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller or the anxious turtleyokai the biggest danger with miikes access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry which he flirts with is overkill on this end hes got everything down im sure with storyboards and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions one of them is when all is said and done and tadashi and the other human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant and some visuals like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map just seem weak and pat i almost wondered if miike might dip into bad spy kids territory quite franklybr br but this liability aside the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement goofy thrills and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies it owes a lot to cinema as well as traditional japanese folklore but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats its not the filmmaker at his very best but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage its got a neat little message and lots of cool adventure 7510
