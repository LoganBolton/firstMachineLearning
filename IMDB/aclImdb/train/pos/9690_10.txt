paulie was cute cool enjoyable and quite fulfilling i went to this movie expecting to view a typical family movie one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor my mindframe immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movies wholesomeness it is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined wholesome most are cheaply made written and produced purely to attract young family members wholl then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plotsbr br oh yes paulie had a plot it told the story of a young girlmarie and her best friend paulie the parrot who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her maries dorky jerk father found this unbelievable and thought paulie to be damaging to his 4year old daughters mental health and quickly tore them apart we follow paulies adventures and misadventures as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner meeting many memorable characters along the way oh yeah paulie really could smarttalk and had a swift new jersey accent cool the plot held thick and entertaining throughout keeping me attracted paulie is the best family movie i have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed ever seriously pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family no sleeping i promise
