some people might call paulie a kids movie but i wish to assert that its more than that probably more than anything else this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states  topical given the recent debates portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor tony shalhoub of how he searched america for his original owners the movie tells several stories theres the elderly woman gena rowlands whom he befriends then a mexican immigrant cheech marin and othersbr br all in all its a very well done movie i usually dont expect much from these sorts of movies but this one is a treat i certainly recommend it also starring jay mohr buddy hackett bruce davison hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado
