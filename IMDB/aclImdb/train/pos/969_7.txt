miike makes a childrens adventure film not unlike the neverending story its actually one of my least favorite of the directors films even the worst miike is better than a good many films though and the great yokai war has a lot in it thats worth recommending its at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it the dvd includes an english dub but like all of miikes films it can tend to move very slowly that means youve got kind of a weird unevenness where sometimes theres a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse the story itself isnt very good either and miikes perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head most of what i liked came from the technical side of things this has to be miikes most expensive movie and it looks fantastic yokai are japanese spirits and they come in all different fantastical forms and the costume designers special effects crew and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job ive seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on yokai monsters spook warfare and the cheesy rubbersuit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using stateoftheart makeup and special effects i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys or girls in this case agi who sports dark eye shadow a tight white outfit a white beehive hairdo and a whip shes played incidentally by chiaki kuriyama whom you might remember as lucy lius teenage henchgirl in kill bill vol 1 the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki who provided voices for miyazakis spirited away and howls moving castle
