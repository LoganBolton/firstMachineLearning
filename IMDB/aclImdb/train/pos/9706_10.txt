the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest strangest darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time so much so it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk many of which have copied the style but have never succeededbr br unlike every other sketch show around the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey in the back of beyond of northern england br br the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad the pigfaced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably dont know of its existence other oddities include the denton family with an obsession with hygiene chastity and toads hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat pauline a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens mr chinnery kindhearted vet and menace to all things fourlegged geoff tipps a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour often involving guns electric tubes and        plums br br despite being a comedy at heart the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other peoples material there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker a pair of silent twins an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic vulnerable light the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this but some fans may decide they belong localbr br the equally underrated third series also takes a different route instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two theyre certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be and how unafraid to explore new areasbr br in short the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look as like the welcome signs says youll never leave
