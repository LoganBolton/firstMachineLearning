i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television since then i have never missed an episodebr br its humour is very weird like a cross between brass eyes social commentary the fast shows excellent oneliners and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere the best example of this was hillary brisss special stuff  what was that all aboutbr br the humour will not appeal to all some will say its just too sick and its easy to see where theyre coming from nonetheless give it a try if you dont like it dont watch it but if you do like it youll be very glad you took my advice
