now i have seen a lot of movies in my day but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me and im a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies almost all the acting is believable the graphics are decent for which you wont even be caring about as you watch the movie trust me bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do the story is well written and its a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kidsbr br heres basically what this movie made me to it one made me laugha lot two made me feel for the characters like youre suppose to and three its a very uplifting story by the end of this movie you will feel good sure what anime out there hasnt featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil its a formula that is used a lot but in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics youd see 5 years ago the appearance of it is not to be judged its very touching the ending is original and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to if you however try comparing this to other movies like the neverending story or whatever it will diverse your opinion watch it as it is and you will enjoy itbr br it has been a good long while since ive been impressed like this the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it so dont overanalyze or take this movie too seriously just enjoy it
