another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks also aptly yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy noncritically and black comedy also well worth considerationbr br watch the whole thing all three series at the end all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel the detail and intricacies are staggering thoroughly postmodern wickedly funny and startlingly tragic not for kids not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity thoughtprovoking at once literal figurative and surreal in disturbing ways the blackest comedy i can recallbr br and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see
