what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman showbr br im sure youve all seen the matrix by now the creators of the matrix say that it is anime inspired just from watching the trailer to this classic you can see where they took the plot frombr br the film is sort of set in 1980s japan and it really shows the costumes music and wordsin the recent english language version by ad vision are all like theyve been directly lifted from the era i believe it was made in that time also but due to certain plot points this doesnt date the filmbr br as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix the world isnt real its not really the 1980s in fact its something more like the 2480s after a nuclear war the earthor biosphere primes ecosystem was destroyed the survivors were forced to escape into space where the conflict continued once the planetsor biospheres were all abandoned people began to live in megazones  cities inside of spaceships where via hypnotism techniques and truman showesque illusion they were made to believe they were back on earth in the most peaceful time in recent memory the 1980s when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle it leads him to find out more than hes supposed to know the garlanda bike which becomes a mech a weapon from the 2400s aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military as more and more is discovered about the megazone the war comes closer to home and due to conflicts between the military and the computer the war comes to the megazone too i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsisbr br emotions run high in this movie moreso than the matrix you really do believe the war is going on and shogo really does become quite scarred by what hes discovering what starts off as an uberhappy cool 80s flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality these characters are real people not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullettime in the matrix there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy and a war it may just choke you up towards the end i know it did mebr br animation is pretty impressive for its day and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for its age the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime very cultural be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood theres also an erotic sex scenebr br the ending can be seen as a there can be no ending similar to the matrix or supposedly can be followed by the sequel which i havent yet had the pleasure of watchingbr br i have to say that this is one of the best animes ive seen in fact one of the best movies ive seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all timebr br i must recommend the advision dvd as their take on the english language is incredible and does the movie justice and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released which will have the same vocal castbr br all in all megazone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be held highly and should be an essential in any anime fans collection heck even my mother enjoyed it
