simon pegg plays the part of sidney young a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous he is making a career out of lampooning celebrities although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his coeditor and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie br br he is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication called sharps magazine in the movie and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day he meets the chief editor clayton harding played by jeff bridges who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goofoff like young to keep his job at the magazine he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of youngs offthewall antics and inappropriate behavior br br much of the comedy in the movie is derived from youngs misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous but sidneys reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and it would seem he believes in that ageold saying  if you cant beat em join emand then beat embr br complicating matters are two very different women there is a charming regular girl at the magazine named alison olsen kirsten dunst who at first is appalled by sidneys obvious arrogance and womanizing ways and a stunning model named sophie megan fox who represents the celebrity culture needless to say sidneys endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for sophie the one with the look of a starbr br sophie is stunningly beautiful its true but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head alison is a regular girl not very interesting or attractive but dunsts performance makes her a real person a relationship with her would have all the reality of a britney spears marriage and yet the movie retains some level of believability because despite how obvious this is we also feel sidneys pain in not pursuing her i felt it anywaybr br how to lose friends and alienate people has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest satisfactory performances and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act it has a variety of welldeveloped and interesting characters danny huston for example gives us a great performance as alisons other love interest who pays homage to the big lebowski also starring bridges with his everpresent white russian one of my personal favorite drinks buying absolute and kahlua here in china costs the equivalent of about 350 but my kitchen is never without them br br i am looking forward to the day when simon pegg will branch out a little bit because i love his films but i am completely unsure about his range he played a serious character in hot fuzz but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him and ultimately went back to being himself again which he has pretty much been in shaun of the dead run fat boy run and now how to lose friends hes a rising star it will be interesting to see what else he can do
