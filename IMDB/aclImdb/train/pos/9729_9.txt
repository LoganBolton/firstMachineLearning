weak start solid middle fantastic finish thats my impression of this film anyway i liked simon pegg in the two films ive seen him in hot fuzz and shaun of the dead his role here though took a completely different turn shows his range as an actor but nonetheless i really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginningbr br theres a kind of humour i call frustration comedy its supposed jokes and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments much like the bean character rowan atkinmson plays there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too i dont mean to bash them here so will notbr br but do be warned that if you are like me and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film it does get better howeverbr br i read somewhere that this is based on a true story hmmm maybe the films story stopped being annoying and became kind of a triumph of the little guy in the final third i dont need all films to be sugar and light but coincidentally as this film got better it also started to be more and more of a happy endingbr br it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite jeff bridges play a role so masterfully i liked iron man but was saddened by the fact that bridges character was a villain purely personal taste of course as his acting in that was superb nonetheless he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision the publisher of sharps it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoybr br overall then i liked it i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late and missed the beginning
