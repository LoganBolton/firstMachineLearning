wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really its a stretch to call this a kids film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits  very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuelesquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kidhero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miikes work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the antiwar  antirevenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folklore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multifaceted adventure fn rad and one of miikes best
