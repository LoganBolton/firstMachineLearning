uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young the journalist on whose reallife experiences this movie is based the key word here is based how to lose friends is a fictitious romcombr br sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it this involves him selling out and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity however they are not overdone the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidneys misadventures the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid wellmeaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart moderately obnoxious skilled writer this contradiction is never that much of an issue because simon pegg as sidney projects likability too wellbr br jeff bridges underplays sidneys editor a little too effectively and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidneys affections and with regard to megan fox who plays an airhead bimbo starlet i can say only this just say the word miss fox and i will leave my wife sell all my belongings and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort of course given that im a fat 56yearold english accountant you might not find my offer too enticing but its there on the table anyway given how short her career has been so far one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become however she does it sweetly with some skill and extremely sexily this girl will go farbr br there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers  miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk gillian anderson and danny huston from the usbr br there are several laughoutloud moments and i smiled most of the way through as ever the fword makes appearances when it really doesnt need to although at least a couple of these are very funny
