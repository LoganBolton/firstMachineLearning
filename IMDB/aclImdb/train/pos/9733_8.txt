how to lose friends and alienate people is an entertaining if loose adaptation of toby youngs memoir of the same name its also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb reviews the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly hollywoodised simon pegg despite playing an essentially irritating person is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now hes rubbing shoulders with hollywood names theres a good supporting cast and its an amusing easy watch  kind of a male ugly betty but funnier
