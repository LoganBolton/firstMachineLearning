oh dear we dont like it when our superhero love interest develops a brain do webr br something has happened to people they have lost the ability to enjoy a simple feelgood love storycomedy kirsten dunst is a revelation  funny sexy and real i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and im not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too the cast acting and script is great i watch a lot of films right across the board and i havent seen one in this genre that has been as successful those who disagree please tell me where i can find some im sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits
