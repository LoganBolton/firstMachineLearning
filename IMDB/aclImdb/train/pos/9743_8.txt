we first watched this film as part of a festival of new argentine films in 2000 at the walter reade although we liked it we didnt think it was extraordinary watching it for a second time we found a different meaning in this look at life in buenos airesbr br the film takes place in one of the darkest days of argentina as the delarua administration was ending the country was in turmoil after the economy which had flourished earlier in the 1990s under the artificially climate president menen created it was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmarebr br the story begins just as santamarina a bank employee is fired because the collapse of the economy instead of receiving sympathy from his wife she locks him out of the apartment and he for all practical purposes becomes a homeless man he takes to the streets trying to make ends meetbr br the other story introduces us to ariel a young jew interviewing for a job in a spanish company its almost a miracle he gets the job his father simon owns a small restaurant in the jewish quarter of el once in the center of the city things go from bad to worse when ariels mother dies suddenly only estela the young woman who is in love with ariel comes to help father and sonbr br santamarina who is a clean man has to resort to take showers wherever he can he chooses a ladies room in one of the subway stations when the attendant elsa finds him naked she becomes furious but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times they become romantically involved and santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage finds an infant elsa while surprised wants to do the right thing but santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their lovebr br ariel who has met the gorgeous laura at work begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful coworker who unknown to him is involved in a lesbian affair ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions feels a passion for laura but he realizes what estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves himbr br daniel burman whose el abrazo partido we thought was excellent did wonders with this film things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around if anything this second time the nuances of the screen play mr burman and emiliano torres wrote make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark daysbr br daniel hendler who plays ariel has collaborated with mr burman before to surprising results he is not movie star pretty yet he is handsome this actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work enrique pineyro is another magnificent surprise his santamarina is disarming in spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets stefania sandrelli the interesting italian actress makes a great contribution to the film with her elsa hector alterio one of the best argentine actors plays the small part of simon the gorgeous chiara coselli is seen as laura and melina petrielli appears as the noble estelabr br esperando al mesias proves daniel burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the argentine cinema
