as someone else commented this is a feelgood movie its got glorious scenery and the wonderfilled voice of luciano ive seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon id forgotten how much i miss pavarottis singing of nessun dorma and i need to get out the cd its a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie eddie albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top but all agents are just that anyway the italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view if you need acting of olivier proportion this movie isnt for you if you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music watch this film just enjoy
