okay lets face it this is a godawful movie the plot such as it is is horrible the acting worse but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only like all of those awful mario lanza moviesjust to hear the voice of the star in this case pavarotti in his prime okay so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women but this movie is about hearing luciano that alone is worth watching the movie a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears finds humility and love along the way and belts out a lot of hit numbers toobr br i must admit im prejudiced on a number of levels im italian im a big pavarotti fan is there anything about pavarotti that isnt big including his fan base and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own seeing the height and depth of lifes possibilities and in love for the first time so as awful as this movie is the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love againbr br yes its corny and awful but the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what its all about so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love especially since he is now gone like italian food that youve never tried before try it you may be pleasantly surprised as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep
