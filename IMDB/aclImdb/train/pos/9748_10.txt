i saw this movie when it came out when i was 17 years old and into classic rock still am br br i never liked opera before because i hate soprano voices but he changed all that he was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice br br i heard on cnn that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer he will be missed and he definitely left his mark on this worldbr br i hope to buy this movie if i can find it watch and enjoy smile maybe i should head over to amazoncom and have a look before its sold out
