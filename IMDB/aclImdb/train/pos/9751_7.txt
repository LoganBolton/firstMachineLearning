once upon a time there were different types of movies these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offerbr br this seems obvious at first but i thought id point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans thats all it is it doesnt claim to be anything else or anything grander people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise arent seeing the whole picture literally after all hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people bodyguard or the preachers wife wwhitney houston are 2 examples that spring to mindbr br first id like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti there are worse things in this world and worse movies the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun the movie starts with schuberts ave maria and then leoncavallos matinatta pav sings arias from la gioconda manon lescaut and turandot but also sings popular music such as i left my heart in san francisco and the song that was nominated for an oscar  golden globe if we were in love wmusic by john williams  lyrics by alan  marilyn bergman all 3 previous oscar winnersbr br the story isnt that bad it was built for pavarotti so of course its not going to be something thats profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer its a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago when asked to sing again at the same place the met in nyc he loses his voice from fear doctor pamela or pahmaylah in italian played by kathryn harrold gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly acceptsbr br they embark on an affair she knowing hes married  promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman despite all that they fall in love thus the song if we were in love and with her help he overcomes his fear  goes back to the met where he triumphs i wont tell how it ends but its fairly predictable which isnt always a bad thing br br the performances in this arent that bad pavarotti who plays giorgio fini isnt an actor so if youre expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance you are deluded not pavarotti he knows hes not a thespian what he is is cute charming  charismatic he is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too its not so bad one funny line is when he tells pamela harrold that shes a thirsty plant fini can water you and of course she says i dont want to be watered on by fini kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semiuptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little one of my favorite lines in the movie is life never has to be life size and theres eddie albert who does his usual good job as finis manager there are several themselves cameos by real conductors singers etc and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center br br if you like opera if you like pavarotti or if you can just let yourself go  enjoy a little fling just like he proposes in the movie then you can enjoy this movie for what it is i know i do every time br br
