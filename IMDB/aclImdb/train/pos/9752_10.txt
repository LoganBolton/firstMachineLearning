i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better i thought it was a good movie then fast forward to just a few weeks ago june 2006 when i rere discovered it thanks to some internet articlesvideo clips and its just not the same movie im sure its still good with the kids but to us 2030 somethings its definitely got cult status written all over it its a shame that the original production went through a painful process if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be but thats for fox to decide im rambling here i know i still think its a great film but it could be better than great
