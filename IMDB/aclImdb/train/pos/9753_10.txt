in our household like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers 7  4 years old at the time and i 10 would watch this movie over and over again we all loved star wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song there are some slow moments the time spent with king kookoo in his court and we generally got bored after the knights song the reason that i sound effect is because i loooooove you but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king kookoo floating there dominating the entire horizon laughing maniacally at the end i still to this day sing hooray for me babbette of gay paris around my friends im 33 now who just look at me as if ive lost my mind however when im singing it im 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars
