richard willaims is an animation god he was hampered in directing this film by the producer the final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story but some amazing moments of animation like emery hawkins greedy joe raposos repetitive music doesnt help either it was made in wide screen so the vhs doesnt show it in all its glory lets hope for a letterboxed dvd someday still its worth watching for some eye popping animation
