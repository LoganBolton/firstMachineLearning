personally this is one of my favorites of all time no im not 10 im 30 i own an old original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store ive watched it countless timesbr br while its an amusing movie for kids its an intriguing movie for adults i once saw this movie whiile i was not sober my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before i saw morals being strongly encouraged both overtly and somewhat subliminally i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular but its been a very long time since then rest assured there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the movie if you get the chance to view it not sober do so you wont be disappointed as a matter of fact you will probably feel rather happy and warmbr br unique and wonderful
