this is a very strange film by directoranimator richard williams all who know of williams work know its a bit offkilter if not ingenious but this one takes the cakebr br it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owners new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality its strange character designs its powerful animation and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary williams brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls floppy and darned rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls which made it more believable at least in a visual sense the animation shines on the bring us the camelwiththewrinkledknees whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end the silentmovie chase with sir leonard looney and of course the greedybr br the greedy animation on its own is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation ive ever seen theres something about this animation that just makes your jaw dropand every second its something new living in what was deemed the taffy pit the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets he sings a song that i cant help but feel hold some sexual undertones then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heartbr br the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs it continuously bogs down the movies pace because there are sixteen of them there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look and what do i see no girls toy blue though they didnt need to make him sing it twice i never get enough because i love you and maybe im home the others just seem unnecessary and frankly arent too amazing to listen tobr br this is a weird film with strange undertones but if thats what youre looking for you wont find better
