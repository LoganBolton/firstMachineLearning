i saw this jolly little film at age 1011 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs i didnt know it had been in a theater at all to rate it from a kids point of view id give it 4 out of 5 starsbecause being a young boy at the timeit seemed a little girlishbr br the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing br br when i rediscovered it a blockbuster video in 1995i had to revisit it i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old i dont know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasnt on vhsbr br its out there might even be on dvd by nowat least i hope it is i want to share it with my kids someday 10 stars on hereits still a great kids film endbr br 09082009  finally found a vhs copy woohoo
