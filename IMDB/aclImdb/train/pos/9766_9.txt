raggedy ann and raggedy andy the movie is about dolls that come to life when the humans arent around in this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named babette from the captain of pirates on their way they journey though deep dark woods taffy pit and even looney land will the aide of their new friend the camel with wrinkled knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him how will they escape the kookoo king and his henchmen what will their owner marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys delightful surprises await the two adventurersbr br all scores are out of a possible 10 story 8  very cute dolls that come to life when the master isnt around not just that because they go out into many many different places but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen meeting new characters going to different places finding new friends its great the characters all work so well in this too and who doesnt love pirates acting 8  every character suits their voice so well specifically the marlon brando taffy pit enemy the greed the french doll has a very uptight french accent the evil hitleresquire king kookoo whos got hair that resembles simpsons sideshow bob plays his role very well and the sorrow old black man voice for camel works perfectly why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones music 10  nothing short of perfection here the songs have been in my head for years and rewatching it nearly 20 years later i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from joe raposo of sesame street fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real wellbr br editing 6  heh this is where itll get confusing i mean how far did the raggedys walk anyway a lot of events just seem to occur one after another and theres no telling who the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie but it does follow some sort of path and you know theyll eventually get to where they need to go its just pretty hard to follow at timesbr br uniqueness 8  between this and unico id have to say theres parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to mainly the scary parts ive probably mentioned already how older movies were much creepier than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor outside of the south park movie and some disney films theres almost no animated musicals or good ones of that coming out so its very uniquebr br worth 8 its classic worth the hunt to get a good copy thats for sure but the vhs copies are probably all stretched out by now the dvd version is sold on ebay all the time and itll definitely be something youll watch more than once if anything get it for the nostalgia purposesbr br overall score not an average 8  its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today its characters are all unique and the songs are great so great you might find yourself humming them time and time again give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today reviewers insight including bias this isnt like the raggedy ann tv series made a decade later this was way more darker and real world the effects in this seem like a lot of other acidtrip cartoons from the 70s in particular yellow submarine still its given me memories ill never forget and might still influence things today it wasnt easy to find but itll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of dvds and videos forever
