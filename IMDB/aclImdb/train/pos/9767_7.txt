oh boy god bless the 1970s we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade the exorcist jaws the texas chainsaw massacre halloween and now raggedy ann  andy a musical adventure this movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world i mean seriously this movie scared the heck out of me my sister had this movie in her vhs collection and i was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money what the heck its kinda funny how this movie is the 1970s version of toy story pretty much down to a key only this was a thousand times scarier disney had alice in wonderland to get into the drug trips for the childrenbr br whenever marcella leaves the room raggedy ann along with her brother raggedy andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life on marcellas birthday a new doll babette arrives from paris france to the united states of america babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll but the friendly raggedy ann does everything she can to make babette feel at home however the pirate captain contagious kidnaps her raggedy ann and andy set off to try to rescue her before marcella discovers babette is gone out in the world outside the nursery the two meet the camel with the wrinkled knees a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely after raggedy ann and andy hitch a ride on the camel he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking runs over the edge of a cliff into a deep pit in this pit they encounter the greedy who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full the raggedys and the camel narrowly escape being consumed by the greedy and continue their journey to find babetteÂ… and believe me it just gets weirder from this point onbr br while this movie was certainly disturbing and i just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie this was actually pretty creative back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it you can tell that they did that with raggedy ann  andy a musical adventure this certainly wasnt the worst movie i have ever seen i just dont know who to recommend it too as scared as i was i have to admit im glad i watched it sometimes you need a wtf movie to spice up your selection believe me when i say that raggedy ann had no problem in doing just that with me its official that doll is just plain creepy lets just put it this way theres a giant caramel river that is eating everything a king whos head keeps getting bigger as he laughs a bizarre thing that humiliates raggedy ann and her brother a strange almost incest between ann and andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs yikesbr br 710
