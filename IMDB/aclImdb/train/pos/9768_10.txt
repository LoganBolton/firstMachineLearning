this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye ill never forget my experience watching it i dont understand why people dont think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull pacino in scarface and crowe in gladiator combined this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hijinx ensues to say the least by the way im saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage
