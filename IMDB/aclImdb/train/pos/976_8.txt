takashi miikes incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark even as a kid i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen to people in most childrens books miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier and more disturbing than what they appear to be at first glance the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with neverending hazardous missions westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain but a selfpossessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers i thought it was a great film highly recommended
