this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it or even better you could buy it because chances are youre going to watch this over and over i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then but after watching it again yesterday ive found it to be amazingbr br a good blend of comedy although not as great as mr magooanother one of my favorites and action this deserves 1010 and im hoping that they will make a sequel soon fingers crossed if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then id recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours
