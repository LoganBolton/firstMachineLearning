the plot is real horrific the atmosphere really depressive unusual for a lowbudget production like that and at least for a german production a little bit of indian spirituality mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together the development of plot and characters are great the sets very close to reality without any studioatmosphere it could be perfect but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing what dont inevitably have to be typically for lowbudget moviesbr br 1 the cast sometimes is not more than average almost every actor look like a layman some of them do a good or a very good job but some are acting like the actors of crappy german courtshows but i was very very disappointed of the acting of mathieu carri√®re his acting  in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine  here was belowaverage but that could be the reason why he today takes part in crappy german soaps or tvseries on private channelsbr br 2 the dialogs are sometimes on soapoperalevel br br 3 the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand what the characters are saying i saw it on dvd and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again it caused by the set  big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group  and sometimes the strange dialects of the actorsbr br but all in all it is an interesting movie worth to watch it far beyond the commercially movies which are often more terrible
