this movie has its ups and downs but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the badsbr br whats not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue the sounds the lightingam i the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur and the actingbr br what is very good are the highly original storyline the very intense atmosphere the gore factor which is very high and the effects which are done supremelybr br so definitely worth watching or maybe even a mustsee for all you horror and gore fans
