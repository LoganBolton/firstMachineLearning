i had initially heard of tears of kali a while back and it sounded like something id be into but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis it kinda fell off my radar while roaming around the local wonderbooki spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up i have to say im pretty glad i did tears of kali is a strange gory sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by its obviously low budget  but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watchbr br tears of kali centers around the fictional indiabased taylorerikkson cult group that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individuals inner demons  but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough depending on your viewpoint as dark forces are not only exorcised but also unleashed upon hapless victimsbr br the film is told anthologystyle with a short but memorable and eyeopening intro sequence and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the filmbr br the first shakti is about a journalist who visits one of the cultmembers who is being held at a mental hospital the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylorerikkson cult but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home when the interview takes a violent turn the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her headbr br the second part devi concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylorerikkson alumni and his rehabilitation methods are far from the normbr br the closing story kali revolves around a quack faithhealer and his assistant who perform miracles for a fee when the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new hostbr br i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of kali there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent  but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is my biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired overdubbed dialogue the dubbing is subpar and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track some reviewers have said the acting is poor which i dont necessarily agree with i think that the dubbing is so lackluster that it makes the performances seem stunted which isnt really the case in fact a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling the doctor in the second segment and the client in the third readily come to mind and notable the gore fx are very well done for a lowbudget film with some graphic scenes of eyelidremovalviacuticlescissors a pencilinthethroatsuicide some decent but irritatingly shaky selfflaying and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure not as rough as some of the more extreme gore films out there but definitely stronger than your average horror fare i also found the story concerning the cultgroup to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horrorstory nonsense there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension the likes of which i havent come across in a while although flawed in some fundamental ways i still think tears of kali will appeal to most underground horror viewers  some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer definitely recommended  8510
