let me be the first non australian to comment on this  i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end its one of those drama of life films as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptivebr br i liked the light and the girls the rest was without too much fault but without too much merit either i yearned for something like the interview or at least some matrix villain element here and there but nothing out of the ordinary the story does teach one about facing ones own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close so not much of an effort to change things is requiredbr br the smart american beauty soundalike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of filmbr br in the end i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life but to me it didnt seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didnt seem attractive as a storybr br i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie
