billed as takashi miikes first family film  by people who havent seen zebraman presumably yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of familyfriendliness diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors but i think its probably just that he wanted to do something different hes really never been a onetrick pony but often gets accused of it  perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless its a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention intobr br theres a very cartoonish feel to the production evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects arent going to be seamless hollywood style work  some bluescreening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stopmotion and puppetry i think the little sockpuppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the cuter for it  the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job  its so hard to find a preteen who actually understands the concept of acting but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixieeared river princess  yum yum those looking for another violent perverted gangster film arent going to find what theyre looking for in yokai but if youre a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit theres plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company youve got
