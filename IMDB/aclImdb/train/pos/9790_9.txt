although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superbbr br yaara studying at princeton returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend talia because yaara practically lived with her friends parents after the death of her own mother she has lost her adoptive sister and because yaara blind from birth has been guided and guarded by talia her friends suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicablebr br inevitably the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death though without sight she has insight though she cannot see she is able to find what is out of sight than the normal people around her the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia in her adoptive familys house in tapes diaries and people in talias past and presentbr br told from yaras point of view the film is also seen from her point of view as she visualizes what she hears believes and imagines the solution to the mystery is rather conventional but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare that the pat moment is easily forgiven the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably clarifying not only talias life but also her relationship with yaara tali sharon as yaara uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl we accept fully her ability by the films end to find her place in the world more confidentlybr br noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious the deadon acting by the minor characters and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager i will quibble with yaaras final declaration as stands with gadi talias last boyfriend at a cliffs edge but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled
