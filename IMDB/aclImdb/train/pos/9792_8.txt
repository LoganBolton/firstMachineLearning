once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you you dont have make an effort to think it is good its just is you enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you i cant say it is totally flawless but its near acting  great story interesting and with elements of suspense its a small family story pretty much predictable but its not the secret itself that matters it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship the blind girl and her cousin the only thing i didnt like that much is the actress that played the mother she was too tough and without necessity keren
