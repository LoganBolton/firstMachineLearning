batman mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to videodvd movie to be released minor spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a new crimefighter the batwoman who seems to be personally involved for whatever reason in stopping a major arms shipmentbr br although the movie is interesting enough its not as good as mask of the phantasm subzero or return of the joker the main reason being is that it doesnt give off the emotional appeal the other movies did at the end of this movie we dont really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others especially subzero there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us even the batwoman is not really a tragic character as mr freeze or phantasm were not only that but batwomans alter ego seems so incredibly stiff and dull that the viewer doesnt really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we dont get this special emotional appealbr br dont get me wrong i did find the movie enjoyable it does have its moments such as when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original batman the animated series the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful momentsbr br if the batwomans background was more interesting this movie would have been better than return of the joker in my book but as it is now its in 4th out of 4br br as for the animation its the same as the new batman adventures cartoon from the mid to late 1990s the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films but its still good nonethelessbr br i do recommend buying this dvd because despite its flaws it is enjoyable but just remember its not as good as the other batman animated moviesbr br 710
