it aired on tv yesterday so i decided to check it out this was one of the last bruce timmpaul dini dtv projects related to their old 1992 batman the animated series after that jeff matsuda came along and reimagined batman with his new the batman series but anyway the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as batwoman however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods and also in the meantime take down the pengiun and ruphert thorn who both are secretly working with carlton duquesnewhos having family troubles and another villainwhich is later revealed in the movie on a weapons smuggling operationthey also put a bounty on the batwoman the question is who is this mysterious batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one its up to batman to solve this mystery and stop penguins latest operation for an animated movie it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone which is good another plus was the complete redesign of the penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated mob boss were used to seeing in the comics unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from tim burton vision of pengiumsewer rat and circus freak even though the movie contains a love subplot its never carried that far and doesnt derail the movie like say batman forever the voice acting is standard quality for these directtovideo projectsif only batman mask of phantasm took this route kevin conroy still shines as batmanbruce wayne and like i said despite running for some very short 80 minutes it manages to make a pretty goodand complex storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action there are a few downsides however nightwing is nowhere to be seen and im sure barbara gordon and bruce wayne dont click as a couple even though is just referenced tim drakeaka robin does very little in the movie and to be quite frank i was never a big fan of paul dini and bruce timms batman character designespecially in their batman shows postbtas this the new adventures of batman and robin well it kinda makes batman look fat then rather a wellbuilt bulked up individualkinda like the jeff matsuda character model from the batman bruce wayne seems a bit awkward those blue eyes make him look more like clark kent then brucethough its true they do look very much alike another downside is rupert throneno explanation as to why he is in this deal but its safe to say hes has goons and whats a cut of the deal which does very little more then hang out with the penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someonecount how many times this happens in the movie and youll be surprised overall a good batman animated movie worth at least a rental
