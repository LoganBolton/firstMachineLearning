the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness theres a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman so much more than batman forever or batman and robinbr br theres a new crimefighter on the streets of gotham she dresses like a bat but shes not a grownup batgirl and batman is denying any affiliation with her meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work but the penguin bain and the local mob makes things little more complicatedbr br i didnt have high hopes for this un since being strongly let down but the weak batman sub zero robin isnt featured so much herebut i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without keep your ears open for a really catchy song called betcha neva which is featured prominently throughoutbr br its a shame the dvd isnt so great dont get me wrong there are some great features the short chase me is awesome and a very cool dolby 51 soundtrack but the movie is presented in pan and scan batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1851 but this dvd is presented in 1331 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen warner have had to rerelease literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond mebr br i would give this dvd 55 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 45 its a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package
