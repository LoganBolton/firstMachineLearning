capital city fans rejoice this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and ive recently got my copy although very much an ensemble piece of key maverick trading floor characters capital city does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line the cultural mix english irish american german polish of head trader wendy foleys played by joanna phillipslane group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and to most people seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and oldfashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf richard le parmentier and james farrell denys hawthorne i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendys team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive free spirit peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy relaxed modern way of business become a reality to a certain degree wendys i am led to believe immediate supervisor leonard ansen john bowe follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the middle ground on most occasions the main interest in the series i believe stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodges declan and the cool selfassured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann played by trevyn mcdowell which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendshipfondness that they undoubted havebr br looking forward to browsing through this title and hopefully the second season of thirteen wont be too far away
