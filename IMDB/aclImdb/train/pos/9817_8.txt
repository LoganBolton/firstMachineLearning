i remember this movie quite intense for an 11 year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard id watch it again if it were rebroadcast but the signal is passing pluto as i write this robert culp a highlight of his career i am just glad i didnt live in that neighborhood oh those 70s what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for prepubescent suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in lodi nj the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the filmand then they left the carcass on the stoop rotten kids
