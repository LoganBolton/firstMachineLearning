this is a very good made for tv film it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970s and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around the worst  most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family but boy does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end the fatherhomeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is he stands up to them and protects his home and his family a very good actori might addbr br i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 i have never seen it again on tv and would like to definitely a good one its the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and cant stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend its the kind they just dont show anymorebr br it is definitely worth seeing
