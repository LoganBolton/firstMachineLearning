i saw this film on true movies which automatically made me sceptical but actually  it was good why not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in its depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancybr br its not dawsons creek theyre not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge theyre kids and they act like kids would br br theyre blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i dont think so dermot mulroney gives when not trying to be cool a very believable performance and i loved him for it patricia arquette is whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers the combination of the two isnt exactly lavender on your pillow the plot was very predictable and but so what i believed them his stress and inability to cope  her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together i think the characters acted by anyone else would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they werent it reflects the surreality of the situation theyre in that hes sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby i felt angry at her for that i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her i felt it allbr br in the end i loved it and would recommend itbr br watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session  career performance
