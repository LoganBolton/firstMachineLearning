i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years its not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting its about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most important its not a sin to have a child when youre a teenager and still in high school and its not really a bad thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this great movie and if they did they clearly didnt get the message behind it all its about not taking chances when youre in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time its not a myth you dont necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about firstbr br this movie has a clear message behind it just say no
