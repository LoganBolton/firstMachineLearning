i really thought this wasnt that bad not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far patricia arquette was overacting much of the time he was actually playing cello which was very impressive and his lines were never forced besides he is an incredibly beautiful man really sexy add that to the talent and most anything hes been in is a lot more tolerable he always gives his all even if some of the projects hes been involved in didnt quite hit the highest mark not the fault of the actor in most cases hes unfortunately been in some strange films that just didnt resonate at the box office always with alist actors but just not always a hit but he is worth every penny of any dvd rented or purchased see the wedding date with debra messing  one of his best overall films worth every penny   if you havent seen it yet do then youll understand that quote
