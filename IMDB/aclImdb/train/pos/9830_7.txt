nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombieflicks but  honestly  why would we bother every single film in the zombiseries delivers great fun nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity every ingenious idea from george a romeros night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at yet all this didnt upset me for one moment because the sublime overthetop gore compensates for everything on a secret army base at the phillipines scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport after a failing attempt to steal the virus the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombieashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area this movie is comparable to umberto lenzis nightmare city truly badbut incredibly entertaining with fastpaced action sequences and several very creative zombiemadness situations the undead birds were original for example and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as its made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick recommended to the fans dont mind the negative reviews
