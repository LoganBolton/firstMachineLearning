a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon and in the process of trying to escape he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised soldiers are able to retrieve the case but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out they eventually make it to where hes hiding and cleanse the hotel and its occupants unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation and if youve seen return of the living dead you know what happens nextbr br zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike as a complete mess of a movie while thats a fair assessment its not without its high points for one thing it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gorehounds happy theres an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible theyre in the water the rafters of houses hiding in trees and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape theres even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator you have to see it to believe it as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors ive seen but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie sometimes its nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesnt require anything more than your time and an open mind zombi 3 fits that bill and then some its even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers and watch it with some like minded friends i give it an 810 just because of sheer enjoyment
