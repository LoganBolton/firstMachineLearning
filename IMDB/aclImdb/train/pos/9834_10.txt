yeah sure its cheesy its not zombie but its not that bad either it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus and its entertaining i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience as he was never completely satisfied with it it is well worth a search out especially for genre and fulci fans it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand
