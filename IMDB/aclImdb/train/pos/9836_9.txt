although its not as creepy as its cult classic predecessor zombi 2 i actually like this one better this is because of its faster pace better settings and cool 80s soundtrack its loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci the zombies dont quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good it was made pretty well but it definitely has its share of cheesiness for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas some are braindead while others say funny lines but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror theres even a flying zombie head how rad is that definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans itd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well also check out zombi 4
