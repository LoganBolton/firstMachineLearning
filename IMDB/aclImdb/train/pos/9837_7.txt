zombi 3 has an interesting history in its making firstly it is a sequel to fulcis hit zombi 2 with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a romeros dawn of the dead aka zombi confusing enough basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running timebr br zombi 3s plot is your typical zombie fare scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines terrorists steal it unleashing a plague and zombie run amok the scientists want to create an antidote while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet br br overall i actually liked this film i heard horrible things but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution corrupted military man playing god etc i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it veered off in a weird direction presumably when mattei came on boardbr br besides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of romeros the crazies you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with when you see the men in white suits  gas masks run to them for help this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies later they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular uncontaminated people is killed by mistakebr br the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner how is it cool let me count the ways1 zombie birth 2 flying zombie head 3 zombie birds 4 zombie with no legs swimming in a pool my favorite zombie was the machetewielding maniac at the gas station he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girlbr br favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie the scientists asks dont you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything to which the sargeant boldly replies now youre talking science fiction he also continues to mention the science fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone diesbr br extras gallery trailers and interviews most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant detailsbr br bottom line a must see for zombie and fulci fansbr br rating 710br br molly celaschi wwwhorroryearbookcom myspacecomhorroryearbook
