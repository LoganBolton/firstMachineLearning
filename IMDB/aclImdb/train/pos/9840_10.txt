born again the limerick br br if a man could come back from the dead br br and live in a little girls head br br revenge he would get br br for the murder he metbr br by the guy thats now in his wifes bedbr br for me born again is a highly underrated classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the xfiles for me before i started watching it i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl i tell you i couldnt sleep for weeks for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night youd think her parents would have been worried and maybe they were we just dont really see that part of the story and was was with the telekinesis other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story there really wasnt any kind of good explanation for it but even with its little flaws in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it 10 out of 10
