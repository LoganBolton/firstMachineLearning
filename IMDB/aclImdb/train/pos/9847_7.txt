had fun watching this film despite the feeling i got a lot of the time that this film was almost copying monsters inc therere quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two the relationship between an animalmonster and a small child other animals trying to break that relationship etc it felt like that pretty much throughout the film to mebr br one of the redeeming features though is scrat  very very funny character even if he serves no purpose
