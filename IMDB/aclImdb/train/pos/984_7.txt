i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not im glad i gave it a chance br br bait aint perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film br br most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i dont know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell hes working on instinct and instinct doesnt fail himbr br the plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and theres even a character arc through which foxxs character grows as a person again they couldve slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much betterbr br im surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but id give it a 710 bravo mssr foxx
