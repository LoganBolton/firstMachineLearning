spoilersbr br i wasnt sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by itbr br i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had even less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature but alas they torture him right until the end of the movie those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars but i do recommend the movie even for a sequelbr br 810br br quality 910 entertainment 710 replayable710
