while i loved this movie the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit highbr br i own the dvd so dont get me wrong i am not saying dont watch it or even buy it its just that i still think the first scene was the best and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it
