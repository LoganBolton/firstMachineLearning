i wouldnt go so far as to not recommend this movie since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie  the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems that doesnt make it bad just not something id go farbr br it is a little saccharine so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously forkids movie like thisbr br however all of that goes out the window when that squirrel the one in all the trailers comes onscreen his time is limited but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys hey could you stick in a little more squirrel every time its getting intolerably dull that doesnt save the movie but you can leave saying at least there was one aspect where i couldnt stop laughingbr br and of course visually it wont disappoint but thats almost a given with pixar flicks of all of their stuff id put this at the bottombut that isnt in itself bad
