ice age is not only animation of the year in my eyes its also the best animated feature ive ever seenbr br the teaser excited me last year and ive spent many happy hours on the website scrat is cool and so are the rest of the sub zero heroesbr br the animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed its hard to say which one really steals the picturebr br i experienced their journey with laughter tears and amazement nothing was forced or over done the emotion was genuine especially in the dramatic second half the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 also a fox production and before that it was the land before time 1988 all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience not just the cynics 1010 br br
