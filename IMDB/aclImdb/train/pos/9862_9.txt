finally i got to see the infamous ice age apart from maybe not being as dead funny as id hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word i can say about it sure its not as glamorous as a disney productionbesides it is foxs 1st attempt at a full length cg movie but its got immense heart and on some occasionslike the look in manfreds eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past i found myself on the verge of tears but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldnt hold them in anymore a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clich√© and manages to bring more than the best out of it the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen great funny looking characters that quickly grow on youand great voice talents as well and many funny memorable scenes especially from scrats behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go plus the dodo scene which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002br br i honestly dont get it but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one and who can forget pixars creations then i dont really mind at least for now 910
