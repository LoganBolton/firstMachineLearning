id have to say this is one of the best animated films ive ever seen i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing just a few weeks ago i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office apparently a lot of people liked this moviebr br a gorgeous color palette man this looks good and a lot of good adult but clean humor make this a big winner the opening 34minute scene with scat is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him sid the sloth voiced by john leguizano however provides the main humor in the movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the moviebr br ray romano is the voice of the mammoth the big character of the film literally while denis leary is the ferocious badguyturnedgood sabertooth tigerbr br this isnt just humor and pretty colors but a nice sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters this isnt interrupted with a lot of songs either one only brief one and there is nothing offensive languagewisebr br if more animated movies were this good id own more
