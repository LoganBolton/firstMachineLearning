almost every review of this movie id seen was pretty bad its not pretty bad its actually pretty good though not great the judy garland character could have gotten annoying but she didnt allow it to somewhere along the line ive become a fan of brooding overbearing overacting van heflin at least in the early 40s judys singing is great but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship i gave it a 7
