this is a gorgeous movie visually the images of the mexican desert the old mansion the characters in their picturesque costumesall amount to a real work of artbr br the story seems a bit loose but thats because its not meant to be realistic it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated otherworldly atmosphere of latin america so far from god and so close to the united states the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin americas international debt burden although there many layers of meaningbr br if you can appreciate a slowmoving richlytextured movie this one is for you
