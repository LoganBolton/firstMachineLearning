erendira is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about the film only exists in a low quality vhs format its a shame this film hasnt been given a dvd release erendira is stunning and gorgeous with its magicrealist images erendira is based on a short story from the novel 100 years of solitude erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandmas house her evil grandma played by irene papas forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages the whole town gets a piece of erendira so to speak although the subject matter sounds harsh the film doesnt exploit sexuality its done in a mature artistic manner the film also has some amazing costumes some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the origami birds that morph into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center erendira is an amazing film that even manages to throw in humor this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release as theyd say in espanol es muy muy bien  excellente
