i first rented this film many years ago and was completely enthralled by it just recently feeling a strange need to revisit some of the waytoofew films that ive immensely enjoyed in my lifetime i decided to give erendira another look and im glad i did as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this filmbr br the story is about a teenaged girl erendira played remarkably by claudia ohana  in some respects she resembles winona ryder who accidentally burns down her grandmothers mansion after which the grandmother played downright hypnotically by irene papas forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages br br the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling  though inspite of the basic premise which deals with prostitution is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn  which by the way is in the rough and tumble part of rural mexicobr br the film is very atmospheric arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality it sometimes borders on the bizarre but not to the point of say a david lynch film its also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature read the comments from previous viewers belowbr br often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion quiet and melancholy adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting the cinematography of the rural places many of which are in the desert is quite superbbr br the film moves at a nice pace neither too fast nor too slow and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again just because it makes you want to do that for me anyway it really is that compellingbr br hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version with subtitles i studied spanish in high school as well as in college and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue por ejemplo el mundo no es tan grande como pensaba the worlds not as big as i thought  ie its a small worldbr br this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine which upon drinking is immensely satisfying however you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there arent more bottles just like this one
