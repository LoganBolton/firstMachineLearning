this movie is such cheesy goodnessbr br a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school they start getting killed off they know they are being stalked so what do they do one girl decides to take a bath another decides to cheat on her husband who is also there with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed in an old abandoned school and go at itbr br and it comes through with the gore and the tabr br and its also interesting from a historicalsociological point of view where the usual 80s slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves or how adults view young people or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective this is a brit film made to be an american slasher its hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak american unintentionally slip back in to their uk accentsbr br if you like cheesy 80s slashers like pieces then you will like this one
