i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months i was actually surprised at how good it wasbr br the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burnedbr br a few years later the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party though not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this partybr br later through the film the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible i can certainly tell you that they are gory as wellbr br at the end of the film you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened but marty is in the hospital with severe burns although the murders didnt happen the burns and the pranks apparently did happenbr br the acting is terrible but that is finebr br i love the story i really sympathize with marty its like tamara 2005 the bullies get whats coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revengebr br i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashersbr br i give this movie 8 stars out of 10 good cheesy slasher
