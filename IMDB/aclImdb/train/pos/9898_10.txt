my 1010 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked slaughter high even before watching it yes its the typical revengeseveralyearsafteradirtyprank story but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here i couldnt have predicted that bathtub scene in a million yearsbr br ok so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new well it doesnt pretend to its the sort of flick that the characters in scream probably watched and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie after all who doesnt like to watch people suffer for doing these things obviously its got sort of a reactionary undertone as people get punished for doing what the 60s championed but still you gotta love this stuff so with apologies to don mclean this jester didnt sing for the king and queen
