i have seen slaughter high several times over the years and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen simon scuddamore committed suicide after the film was released i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans and a few of them arent very good at hiding their english accentsbr br all that aside though this is the tale of the class nerd marty who is the butt of jokes from his classmates and on one particular day april fools day hes lured into the girls locker room by one caroline munro yes playing a teenager and humiliated big time on film of course the coach catches the gang at work  theyre all given a vigorous workout to punish them but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab but its full of something that makes him sick  when he runs to the restroom one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid which leaves poor marty burned  horribly scarredbr br ten years later this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelictexcept theres a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course they eat drink and be merry for soon they will die of coursebr br the gang is stalked onebyone by a figure in a jesters mask but could it be marty they dont know they figure hes either in a loony bin or working for ibm theyre not sure which but whoever it is hes making quick work of them particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time i could be wrong but i believe that wasnt on the tapebr br at any rate theres somewhat of a twist ending and that also contains footage not on the tape i believe theres also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised but apart from that i didnt really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version probably so but its been a while since ive last seen itbr br at any rate if youre a fan of 80s slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd because its a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere  feel to it 7 out of 10
