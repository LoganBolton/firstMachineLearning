this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre which is my favorite genre of them all so when i saw it was free on demand i had to watch it it stars caroline munro from both dr phibes films she was his wife that died dracula ad 1972 the golden voyage of sinbad captain kronos  vampire hunter the spy who loved me maniac and facelessbr br brought to you by the people behind dont open til christmas and pieces heres my thoughts on thisbr br it opens on april fools day where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd promising him sex in the shower and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet all while hes naked the coach puts a stop to it but both parties swear revenge but the cool kids end up burning the nerd alivebr br cut to the future and its th high school reunion or so they think bwahahha the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid and its april fools day or really the day before april fools but the fun starts at midnight yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall then they finally break into the school and it starts stormingbr br inside they find fooddrink and a little shrine for each of them each of their lockers and belongings along with martys the nerds locker and yearbook they also find the old black janitorcaretaker who spends his time saying oooh yesser yesser i dont want no trouble sir and then is killed instantly pretty pointless character but hes still my favoritebr br the movie takes a page out of aliens book in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see thats when everyone realizes that theyre there to die and they start freaking out except for shirley who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this of course it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off very cool mind you the rest of the night goes as usual sex drugs and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask whats their plan all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon marty wont kill us during midday seriously thats what he said apparently you can only kill at nighttime but will they survive through the night who will live and who will die and why are all the bodies disappearing rent buy or steal this great movie to find out the movie is actually very good filled with clich√©s car wont start dammit and just plain slasher fun not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan i recommend it to all of you and not to mention it has a spin off 1989s cutting class is a spinoff from this slasher gem and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowellbr br favorite scene 2 people having sex the guy wants to finish but the girl doesnt talk dirty to me frank she screams uh tits dirtier uh tits fck tits boobs fck it seems to work for her and at her climax the killer electrocutes them both
