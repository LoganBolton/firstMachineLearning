slaughter high is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout that being said it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdownbr br the reason why slaughter high stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more overthetop marty the killer has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girls locker room shower jabbed at his crotch with a javelin and to top it off rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure himbr br so the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get when they reunite years later  at a high school reunion put on by marty himself  you realize they havent matured all that much theyre a bunch of sociopathsbr br it is mindboggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion which by the way is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair and who would think its a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers  as well as martys  on display there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film the ending makes little or no sense and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fools day works the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noonbr br in all the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre despite all of its flaws it is hard to understand why it hasnt yet found its way to dvd when so many other runofthemill slasher flicks are graced with special editions
