god bless 80s slasher films this is a fun fun movie this is what slasher films are all about now im not saying horror movies just slasher films it goes like this a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong disfigured and back for revenge sporting a jokerjester mask pretty creepy looking might i add marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion that is basically the plot whats wrong with that thats the beauty of 80s slasher films most of them i would say a lot of things could be so ridiculous but they keep drawing you more in an in as they go by especially this filmbr br it features some outrageous killings and some are quite creative as well poisoning of a beer can acid bath i cant remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film eitherit really is a fun fun movie thats all it is nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots never mind their stupidity and never mind the outrageous random things that occur in this film such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer when hes not even switching any buttons youll see and toilets being able to cough up blood baths being able to have acid come out of them just use that as part of your entertainment because thats what really makes it entertainingbr br movies like this represent 80s slashers never again could movies like this get made know why it isnt the 80s anymore that is why you should just cherish them for what they are good fun i highly recommend this film if youre a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13thbr br one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well marty rantzen a disfigured nerd who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask a good villain makes a good slasher simon scuddamore who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released that alone adds something creepy to the film and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character i guess all in all great 80s slashers fun its a shame it will never be the same again
