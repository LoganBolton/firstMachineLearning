absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notchi highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasnt seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i wont go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywherebr br a 10
