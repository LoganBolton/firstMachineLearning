i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographers art by presenting the beauty in mans deconstructing the natural landscape it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations setup shots and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror showbr br this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river each sequence stands on its own but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability there are few words this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way an awful massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our ewaste the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards the construction of the three gorges dam the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that wasbr br the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the watersbr br the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully by not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you dont necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what were doing is creating problems that run deep it is not a simple right or wrong it needs a whole new way of thinking the subtlety of this descends into an eitheror proposition but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark sidebr br though never stated directly in any way as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise unlike most films with environmental themes this one ends with no call to arms it argues basically whats the point but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally
