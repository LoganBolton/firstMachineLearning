i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie this movie was not intended to be a deep thought movie which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be in fact it would appear that if any movie doesnt produce a life altering insight and a deep twisted mind boggling plot they would rate it a 1 or 2 dont trash a movie because you dont like the genre peoplebr br this movie was an actioncomedy flick and thats all it was intended to be and for an actioncomedy it was very well done i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did having never really been a jamie foxx fan and having the overused plot that it hasbr br the plot was nothing spectacular using the typical criminal gets out of prison and is thrown into badguy plot while trying to clean up his act see blue streak hudson hawk 48 hours etc etc etc but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the real bad guy is an ubergeekbr br jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character and didnt try to overdo the humor side of the filmbr br if youre looking for a deep underlying plot such as in the matrix or a drama such as of mice and men then this movie isnt for you but if you enjoy the raw action excellent fastpaced filming and an occasional twist of humor tossed in this movie wont disappoint you i would normally have rated it about an 8 on the same level as the die hard trilogy but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should bebr br
