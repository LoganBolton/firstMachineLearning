this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things parts of hightech equipment presumably it isnt really made very clear the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how theyre herded around outside in little yellow jackets the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory and talking with his crew as he does so this is a world of relentless industrialization its a relief at least to know these soulless images arent going to be presented without a human voice as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalters gleefully cold documentary about the food industry our daily bread manufactured landscapes contains images of people scavenging ewaste and a town many towns really being wiped out by the biggest dam ever with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is some of these scenes the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado but this photographer isnt as interested in seeing people up close his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltzbr br all this happens in china of course though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive there are a good many stills of the photographers workor were some of them made by the film crew it isnt made clearbr br edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring he admits himself that he takes no political stand when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the films cinematographer peter mettler burtynskys work almost amounts to a kind of glorification and hence falsification but he is showing us places that if we look closely reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may bebr br logically but not entirely fortunately it is burtynsky whose voiceovers narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites burtynskys epiphanies may have inspired his decades of fine work but they amount to nothing but truisms about how were changing the planet irreparably are dependent on oil which will run out that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel the interest of manufactured landscapes would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it the reasons for watching it are two to see glimpses of burtynskys work and the raw materials the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully and to observe scenes from the vast awesome daunting and rather horrifying industrialization of modern chinabr br because of the limitations of the narration the idea of the title manufactured landscapes feels insufficiently developed it even seems a misnomer new landscapes they are but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than manufactured landscapes of waste or wasted landscapes might be better titles there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions
