ah domino is actually a breath of fresh air something new to the cinema world i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot the varied characters and the intense camera effects ive seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time all of what you see was the desired effect perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before although thats what sets it apart in a deeper aspect what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes think about itbr br when it comes to the story i dont see anything quite bad about it despite its messy nature according to some it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling the plot really isnt all that hard to follow if you actually focus on whats going on maybe its just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting the plot etc im no interpreter or anything who picks movies apart it just comes to me with that said i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed despite its future as a cultclassic blockbuster or whateverbr br and the characters well theres no doubting how varied the cast is i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively thats what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives setting them apart even further basically i personally loved the cast and charactersbr br all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just dont see it as i do or it just doesnt appeal to them no matter this is a great film in its own right no its a great film period
