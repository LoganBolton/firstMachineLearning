domino is a great movie its about a young woman names domino harvey kiera knightley who becomes a bountyhunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle she joins with two fellow hunters mickey rourke  edgar ramirez and the adventures begin the script is good very downtoearth and realistic with the tone of the film the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do instead of the character of dominobr br even with that kiera knightley gives a fierce performance she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance mickey rourke follows up his oscarworthy performance in sin city with another toughguy performance edgar ramirez really doesnt do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance monique was herself although she did surprise me on one particular scene lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with herbr br the best thing about the movie though is the direction tony scotts fastpaced style really brings the movie to life the cinematography is some of the best ive ever seen it takes a regular movie and puts on acid all the blacks are blacker the whites are brighter and it has a sort of green glow to it the action scenes are exhilaratingbr br overall if you liked sin city  man on fire youll like domino
