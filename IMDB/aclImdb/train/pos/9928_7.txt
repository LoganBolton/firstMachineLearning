as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick i said i have to watch this movie shes the undisputed main character domino a bounty hunter her job as the no action scenes would teach us reflects her rebel violent attitude to life i have to admit that its the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters hands so this stomped me a bit anyway for all the john woos fans there are helicopters falling down explosions gunfire as if it would rain and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns one per hand the cast is absolutely brilliant going beyond keira which in this movie is a real tomboy pretty much different from the lovely action figure were used to see mickey rourke is back with his usual slapthrowing face and his potent body christopher walken makes his job pretty well as a reality show producerbr br lets go to the contents this movie has a journalistic shape the talk show scene is disgustingly real anyone that watched that load of    youknowwhat can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations as well as the producer when dominos mom says that the reality that should show dominos life is trash no offense he answers i dont take it like an offense this movie portrays a difficult life domino coming from a world that didnt want her ed mickey rourke a bounty hunter not so bounty choco the third guy of the band which family is using eds words the correctional institutes hes been and alf the driverbomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born without the shirt unlucky violent and with nothing to lose excepts their as they would consider miserable lives the intro of the movie says that it is inspired by true story    more or less so i couldnt possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true anyway going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons which could have been added to make the film easier to see and be classified as an action movie the characters story is too realistic to be edulcorated br br the interaction between the characters is various well studied and definitely not boring what hasnt convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist lucy liu sober as never in her acting career it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story and thats a story probably the only con in a movie with a lot of pros br br all in all this isnt swat the characters are crafted they have an identity a shape they have a name and a surname not just gamble and street its the case to say its the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet
