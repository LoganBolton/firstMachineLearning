im totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum and many of the reviews i think tony scott made a good movie here yes it is highly stylized flashy and over the top but it is very entertaining im glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me  br br this movie may not be for anyone but if you like overthetop dark humor cool action and dialog you should see it br br ive previously seen scotts man on fire crimson tide and enemy of the state  all good movies but i like this one more its like a rollercoaster ride with great soundtrack selections visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 it is nice to see that someone isnt afraid of showing nudity gory violence and have explicit dialogbr br it doesnt hurt that keira is superhot and even shows nipples in this one either
