my name is domino harvery edit dizzying chop mymymy name is domino harvey cut chop my name is domino harvey edit cut playbackbr br never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scotts choppy flashy dizzying editing technique if i have to choose between loving it and hating it id say i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result was pretty good and its nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from mtv videosbr br this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walkens tv production company what is christopher walken doing in every film by the way i guess that is a clever film technique because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtvreality show editing footage as he likes it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this pointbr br it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapidfire pace with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence there are some funny jokes its all very modern and surreal at the same time its a mess but its a rather enjoyable mess it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works i give it a weak 710 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who graded this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them wellbr br 7 out of 10
