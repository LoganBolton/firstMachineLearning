this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained sure some things are simplified but most of it was correct even though it was made 22 years ago and quite understandable i would suggest that all soontobe medical student should watch it it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example now im in my 7th semester and i think ill watch the series once again as soon as ive bought the dvdbox
