this tvseries was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid even though i see it now through the pinkshaded glasses of nostalgia i can still tell it was a quality show very educational but still funny i have not seen the original french version only the swedish i have no idea how good the dubbing was it was too long ago to rememberbr br the premise of the show was to show you how the body works i swear school still hasnt taught me half of what i know from this show it also tied in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and dont exercise with nice examples within the body who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you d the cartoon looked nice very kids friendly of course but done with care cells viruses electric signals in the brain antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures looking pretty much how youd expect what they should look like in the animated bodybr br this and the series about historyespecially the environmentally scary finale were key parts of my childhood im so happy i found them here
