you know the story  a group of plucky nohopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning  its a tale that has been done to death by hollywood bring it on the karate kid escape to victory best of the best etc now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfyingbr br the fact that this movie doesnt fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters and this in turn keeps you watching to the endbr br fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films the action is limited to albeit impressive kicking and the occasional punch this doesnt matter though since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success
