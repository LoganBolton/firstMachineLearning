first things first this isnt an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i think you can compare it to american sports movies where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkablewinning a game or tournament beyond expectation in this case it isnt about football or baseballbut taekwondo in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing but soon we will find out that they dont want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life it is nice to see them struggle and training i was surprised how funny this movie was from start till the end you will laugh your pants off the young korean actors are very convincing go see this wonderful feel good movie
