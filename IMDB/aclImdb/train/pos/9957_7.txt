this film is shockingly underrated on imdb like so many films this isnt shawshank but its a reasonably good if predictable dance competition  personal growth film if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer than i think youll like itbr br judging from the imdb ratings my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was vote bombed with many 1s as happens to so many films that arent about the mob dont have special effects or include nonwhite or nonstraight charactersbr br its an american film but its not a us film set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle and some audiences may think its set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroitbr br i liked the music i liked the dance but not convinced its worth 50000  but what do i know the characters were easy on the eyesbr br i do agree the title sucks i dont remember anyone in the film saying those words and it should have an s no its not a foreign languagebr br theres not a lot to hate about this film and lets be honest a vote of 1 means you hated it so i can only assume that its an expression of hate for the kind of people in it and thats sad
