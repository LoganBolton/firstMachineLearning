i must give how she move a nearperfect rating because the content is truly great as a previous reviewer commented i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list thats absolutely ridiculous other filmsparticular those that share the dance themecant hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of topnotch believable acting and amazing dance routinesbr br from start to finish the underlying story this is not just about winning a competition is very easy to delve into and surprisingly realistic none of the main characters in this are 2dimensional by any means and by the end of the film its very easy to feel emotionally invested in them and even if youre not the crying type you might get a little weepyeyed before the credits roll br br i definitely recommend this film to dancelovers and even more so to those who can appreciate a poignant and wellacted storyline how she move isnt perfect of course what film is but its definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a halfbaked plot andor characters who lack substance the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers
