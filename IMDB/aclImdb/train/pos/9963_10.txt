i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the 70s it was great i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful that was how i remember my christmases were with my family  magical santa claus was amazing and i couldnt wait for him to come back each yearbr br if you have a childchildren and speak spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of santa claus its a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one waybr br its a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i dont know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays feliz navidad
