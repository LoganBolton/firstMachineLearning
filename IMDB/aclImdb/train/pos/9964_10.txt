just get it the dvd is cheap and easy to come by the length is now standard and youve gone long enough without it when home video started there were at least three versions with parts missing everything youve read is true there is no defending it and no living without it the color is lush and wonderful to look at and the production values are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic but no questionthe whole santa vs satan angle is so jaw dropping strange it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway how goodbadstrange is it i only saw the trailer as a kidand remembered it for nearly 30 yearsincluding murrays over the top voice overi told my older sister and she called me a liar and could not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where santa vssatan add to it stuff like santa asking for the virgin marys blessing before setting off on christmas eve kids wanting to capture him and make him their slaveand an international kiddie sweat shopand it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60s like others here i watch the thing every holiday season now my version of choice is the mystery science theatre 3000 edition but any old way you choose it the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must along with brianiac by the wayit never fails to make me laugh better i think then santa claus conquers the martians parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you outhow many parents do you know go out for cocktails on christmas eve if you get bored just go downstairs and play the piano dang freaky boring disturbing funny childish strangehey what more can you want
