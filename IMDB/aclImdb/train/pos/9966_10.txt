i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in 1993 it is the worst thing ive ever seen so bad in fact that by sheer freakiness this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed br br whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten i mean really the devil vs santa visions of hell creepy laughing windup reindeer forced child labor with racial stereotypes it aint sesame street thats for sureas crow exclaims during the mst3k showing this is good ol fashioned nightmare fuel br br theres plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology merlin presumably the arthurian merlin hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds ie heaven santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to mr stork for children who ask for siblings there are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or raf stars br br my best friend and i have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us
