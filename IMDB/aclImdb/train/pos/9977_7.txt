spoilers through br br i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie its not a classic but its definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 ratingbr br perhaps the reason i liked it is because i havent seen the originalsomething tells me that with a movie like this its strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the originalbr br there were a few things i liked about it one was the casting of kowalkski viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders he really needed to be excellent and he was this was a great role for himbr br another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that its made for television i had no idea this was the case when watching it it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen releasebr br i also found the story to be very absorbing im not one for action movies but i got sucked into this plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama mysticism a love story quirky people every which way you turned i didnt even recognize priestly and it was touching this was not a great movie but it is watchablebr br and then theres the ending it packs a strong punch and if ones been involved in the story up to that point its very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end i am not sure how i feel about the ending the implication was that kowalkski survived and though im highly skeptical of how that would be possible it is a movie and realism isnt an ingredient thats always in the mix when making a moviebr br so id have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way which i dont usually like but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie admittedly a lot of things were just props for the plotcould the villains have been anymore stereotypical but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well however having said that i will admit i can understand why someone whos a major fan of the original would hate this version because though i have not seen the original i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results my big dislike is actually sequels but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a qualitybr br people have compared this to smoky and the bandit how about a road version of legends of the fall meets thelma and louese as well i sure felt touches of both filmsboth of which im a fan of i do not think however that this was a great film it was better then average to me but far from great but it was an absorbing adrenalin fueled touching movie with excellent casting of the main character my vote is 7 of 10
