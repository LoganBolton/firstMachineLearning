i have to say i loved vanishing point ive seen the original and this is a pretty good remake of it even though it didnt follow the original storyline thats why i gave it 8 out of 10 it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storylinebr br as for the car well the djs comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable and if you look the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145150 but even though i didnt see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine the original storyline had a supercharged hemi so its possible for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldnt allow it the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph and if you look at that thing going on a highway with it its like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph plus in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic
