to start off with since this movie is a remake of a classic the rating has to be lowered already since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski it helpsbr br isnt this just like the united states government though to terrorize one of its own citizens sounds like jason priestleys character from the movie but it is the truth the government would do anything possible to destroy a mans life for trying to get home to his wife a wife who is in labor no less and may not make itbr br there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife the words of the disc jockeybr br there were some great shots of scenery in this film and great car chases and a lot of spirituality after much consideration i gave this film a 7
