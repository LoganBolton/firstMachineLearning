any movie that shows federal pigs persons in government to be the powermad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to mebr br alas the script supervision and editing and even at times the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good momentsbr br i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it despised it loathed it thought it was a terrible irrational piece of junkbr br now though i dont remember whybr br i believe the two should not be compared or even connectedbr br consider them as two different moviesbr br rate them as two different moviesbr br this vanishing point provides a rallying place a banner for people who want to encourage individualism who believe in human rights who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is especially the federal governmentbr br the voice wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire live free or die at one time it would have been the motto of most americansbr br despite its obvious flaws vanishing point is a film to cheer
