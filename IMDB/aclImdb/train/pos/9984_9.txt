i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama which owing to its rather unimpressive 66 rating i nearly missed as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 710 having said that im so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved and so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living formbr br i must say that in many ways though not all viz its themes execution style production etc stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised the notebook i am so surprised that other commentators didnt pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so i can only assume that those whove written comments have yet to see the notebook they may not share any alzheimers theme yet i can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed the notebook you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with the stone angel but even if youve not seen the notebook nor read the book on which this move is based which incidentally i havent either you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly  as long as your favourite genres dont include fast paced action thrillers this is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about times passing how life changes as the years pass and what might have happened in ones life as one gazes back through the yearsbr br this bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 810 i can only blame its current lowish rating of 6610 on the 11 of idiots who gave it 110 after all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment nonetheless if those 11 who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didnt they look for even a few seconds at the movies premise and promotional lines oh dear whatever the world is coming to dont miss this most underrated gem of a movie  but only if you have a brain ie your top ten doesnt include transformers fight club nor the terminator
