i saw the movie recently and really liked it i surprised myself and cried this movie is in the same niche genre as away from her  or even the bucket list but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity its really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar the director does a masterful job with the challenge hagars hard to understand her world has hard edges and she isnt a warm endearing woman at allbr br the first scene gets this across without any compromise hagar ellen burnstyn is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughterinlaw she figures it out enroute and freaks out her edges are really hard she is mean she is belittling and selfish she is a stone i didnt like her  not even a little bitbr br throughout the course of the movie we get insight we find out why she doesnt like petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character i started to see the angel and i started to like her i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack ellen burnstyn you are a brilliant actor kudos kudos kudos what a scenebr br this isnt a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy i understand more clearly that hard edges in a persons life are there to protect they are there for a reasonbr br hagar isnt my mother  she isnt even my motherinlaw or neighbor but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life those parts somehow make more sense to me now that ive watched the stone angel
