this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss nice story funny richestorags situations mel brooks is not a bad lead maybe not perfect but he is funny d dont pay attention to the rating its bs watch it then watch something like final destination 2009 and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating if you do i dont think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of curb your enthusiasm to every brooks fan  vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms ive to make 10 lines here to post a comment i dont wanna write a book here p
