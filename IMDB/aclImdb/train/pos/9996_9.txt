i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementarybr br i watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the childrens enjoyment made it seem sobr br it is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content  how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults its hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family howeverbr br hence for the children a 910 from me
