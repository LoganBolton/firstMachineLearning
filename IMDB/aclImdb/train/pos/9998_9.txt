seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i didnt have much expectations when renting this filmbr br but contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a charming movie it didnt need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his moviesbr br theres not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch filmbr br very recommended
