a christmas together actually came before my time but ive been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my familys christmas music for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself if you ever get the chance its a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy its also interesting to see the 70s versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like thisi guess normally performers dont compromise their images by doing singalongs with the muppets but im glad he did even if you cant track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too it has some muppified traditional favorites but also some original denver tunes as well
