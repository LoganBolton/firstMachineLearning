workingclass romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro both terrific shes a widow who cant move on hes illiterate and a closetinventoryou can probably guess the rest adaptation of pat barkers novel union street a better title is so laidback it verges on bland and the films editing is a mess but its still pleasant a rosyhued bluecollar fantasy there are no overtures to serious issues even the illiteracy angle is just a plottool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree the finale is pure fluffand cynics will find it difficult to swallowthough these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldnt really be satisfying any other way  from
