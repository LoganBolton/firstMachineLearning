i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances  films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job  responsibilityto save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowingi havent seen such angry seas since the perfect storm costar clancy brown hbos carnivale  great to see him again played the captain of the coast guards kodiak alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins the film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience applauding at the end
