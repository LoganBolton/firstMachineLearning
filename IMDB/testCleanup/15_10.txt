as others that have commented around the web im a 130 pilot in the coast guard having said that and being the skeptic i am i went expecting the overthetop cheese factors there was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accuratebr br i watched the trailer again today after seeing the film yesterday ive realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes this isnt the casebr br the movie is truly more characterstory driven than action the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with kutchers is revealed further into than movie than costners isbr br of course there is a minor love story no surprise there but for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old woundsbr br as girlie as it sounds costner and as much as i try not to like him kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the moviebr br as critics have stated youve seen it all before top gun officer and a gentlemen etc but what movie hasnt been remade a million timesbr br i can recall only one f word being spoken and cant really recall any other languagebr br the movie is 2 hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the endbr br youll laugh you may cry but i can honestly say it was worth the 4 i paidbr br i hope you enjoy the movie
