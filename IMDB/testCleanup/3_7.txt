how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this i cant count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint i was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003  day after tomorrow one line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad riskbr br butbr br see the movie despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard in fact youll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out why costner and kutcher played their characters very well i have never been a fan of kutchers and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian but he surfaced in good fashion costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costners ability i dont think mrs robinson had anything to do with his successbr br the supporting cast all around played their parts well i had no problem with any of them in the end but some of these characters were used too muchbr br from here on out i can only nitpick so i will save you the wear and tear enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water just dont expect a smooth ridebr br 7 of 10 but almost a 6
