i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect unfortunately even though these two actors wereare capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here some of the scenes were just not believable and didnt have enough story line supportbr br though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath there was very little none to that effect in the moviebr br overall i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspectivebr br the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating not sure ill ever go deep sea fishing againbr br i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presentedbr br definitely a movie that couldve been seen on dvd
