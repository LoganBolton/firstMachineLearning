# Iris Dataset Plan

Understand the Data:

Familiarize yourself with the iris dataset: its features and target classes.
Data Preparation:

2.1. Load the Data: Use a library or tool that provides the iris dataset.

2.2. Split the Data: Divide the data into two parts: one for training the model and the other for testing its performance.

Create the Neural Network:

3.1. Install Necessary Libraries: Get any necessary machine learning libraries, like TensorFlow and Keras.

3.2. Design the Network: Decide on the architecture, which includes how many layers you want, how many neurons in each layer, and the activation functions.

3.3. Compile the Model: This is where you'll specify the optimizer, loss function, and any metrics you want to track.

Train the Neural Network:

4.1. Train the Model: Feed your training data into the neural network to adjust its weights.

4.2. Evaluate the Model: After training, check how well your model performs on the test data to gauge its accuracy.

Adjust and Improve:

Depending on your model's performance, you might need to modify the architecture, adjust training parameters, or use techniques to prevent overfitting.
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to classify new iris flower samples.
Visualize and Understand:

Visualize your results and the training process. Charts that display loss and accuracy over time can be particularly helpful.
Examine any errors or misclassifications to gain insights.
Deploy (Optional):

If you want your model to be usable in a real-world scenario, you'll need to integrate and deploy it to the desired platform.
Continuous Learning:

As with any skill, practice and continual learning will enhance your capabilities. Delve deeper into each step, explore other algorithms, and try out more advanced techniques as you become comfortable.
